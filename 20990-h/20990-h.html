<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proclamation announcing James VI of Scotland
to be "by law, by lineal succession and undoubted
right," heir to the throne of England, now that
Elizabeth was dead, illustrates again the ancient right
of the citizens of London to a voice in electing a
successor to the crown. The document not only
acknowledges the assistance received by the lords of
the realm from the lord mayor, aldermen and citizens
of London in determining the succession, but at the
very head of the signatories to the proclamation
stands the name of "Robert Lee, Maior," precedence

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever failings the new king may have had,
he possessed sufficient shrewdness to know the value
of the favour of the City, which he hastened to
acknowledge with "thankfull mynde" within a few

letter the following day, signed by the mayor and
aldermen, in which, after expressing their twofold
feelings of sorrow and joy—sorrow at losing a mother
in the late queen and joy at gaining a father in the
person of the new king—they declared they had used
all their powers to advance his just claim to the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

them through their secretary or remembrancer, "Mr.

messenger.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> The king returned for answer, that
although he had been already aware of the City's
forwardness in joining with the nobility in proclaiming
him rightful successor to the crown, he was pleased
to learn from their trusty messenger that the citizens
had advocated his cause not only from the consciousness
of its being a just one, but also because they
were assured of his zeal for the preservation of
religion.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> This was one of James's mystifying

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 5th April James left Edinburgh for
London, where every precaution was taken to
prevent disturbance by ridding the streets of rogues,
vagabonds and "masterless" men.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> He proceeded
southward by easy stages, accompanied by a long
retinue of Scotsmen, until he reached Theobald's, at
that time the mansion house of Sir Robert Cecil, but
soon to become a royal hunting-lodge. On the

companies to prepare a certain number of members<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc3" id="toc3"></a>
to accompany the mayor in his attendance upon the
king, who was shortly expected in the city. It was
intended that not only the mayor and aldermen but
also the full number of 500 of the "best and gravest"
citizens should wait upon his majesty on horseback,
clothed in coats of velvet with velvet sleeves and
adorned with chains of gold, and each accompanied
by "one comlie person, well apparelled in his doublet
and hose," on foot. In a word, the cavalcade was
to be furnished on a more sumptuous scale than had

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After resting a few days at Theobald's, James set
out (7 May) for the last stage of his journey. At
Stamford Hill he was met by the mayor and aldermen

he had lavishly bestowed knighthoods.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> On the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The coronation ceremony was hurried over owing
to the presence of the plague. Only the mayor,
the aldermen and twelve of the principal citizens<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were permitted to attend, and much labour bestowed
on preparations for the event was consequently
lost.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> The civic authorities did their utmost to stay
the sickness and alleviate distress. The streets
were ordered to be kept better cleansed. Infected
houses were marked with papers bearing the words
"Lord have mercy upon us," and when these were
torn down a red painted cross, fourteen inches in
length and breadth, and not so easily effaced, was
added.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> Persons stricken with the plague were
forbidden to leave their houses. A master who had
been inhuman enough to turn out into the street a
domestic servant who had fallen a victim to the
prevailing disorder was ordered by the Court of
Aldermen to take her back again into his house,<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> a
circumstance which seems to point to the pest-house
or hospital being already overcrowded. Instructions
were given for seeing that the graves of those who
died of the plague were sufficiently covered with
earth, and that the number of mourners attending
funerals should be as far as possible limited.
Women whose duty it was to search the bodies of
the dead, as well as all those who were brought into
contact with the sick, were forbidden to go abroad
unless they carried before them a red rod three feet in
length in order to give notice to passers by. It was
a common belief that infection was carried about by
stray dogs. To those, therefore, who killed dogs
found in the streets without an owner a reward was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
given.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> The sufferings of the afflicted were alleviated,

upon to forego their customary banquets in order to
relieve the poor.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> The plague was accompanied, as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the end of the year (1603) the city was
almost free of the plague, and in the following March
(1604) James determined to make his first public
entry into London. A sum of £400 was raised by
the livery companies<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> for furnishing pageants and
stands for the occasion, and steps were taken to
remove from the streets everything that might be
offensive to the king's eye or ear. Thursday, the
15th March, was the day fixed for his entry, and
from the preceding Wednesday until the following
Friday no refuse of any kind was to be thrown into
the street.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> It was further ordered that no church
bells should be rung before seven o'clock in the
evening of the eventful day, lest the noise should
prove offensive and hinder his majesty from hearing<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the speeches that were to be made.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> When all was
over and the pageants were about to be taken down,
the Court of Aldermen, with the frugal mind of men
of business, ordered the master and wardens of the
Company of Painter Stainers to examine the painters'
work bestowed on them, and report whether, in their
opinion, such work had been well and honestly
executed, and what amount of remuneration the
workmen deserved.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> It is said that the Recorder,
Sir Henry Montagu, welcomed the king on this
occasion with a speech, wishing him on behalf of the
city "a golden reigne," and that a cup of gold was
presented to the king, the queen and the young prince
who accompanied them respectively;<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> but no record

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the first questions James had to decide
on his accession to the throne was that of religious
toleration; and his settlement of the question was
anxiously looked for as well by the Puritans as the
Catholics. The fear lest the policy which the king
should advocate might prove adverse to their interests
determined the Catholics to resort to strong measures,
and the life of James was threatened by a series of
plots, as that of Elizabeth had been before him.
Among these was a plan for seizing the king at
Greenwich on Midsummer-day, 1603. The plan was
laid by a secular priest named William Watson, who
had previously sounded James as to his probable
attitude to the Catholics if he came to the throne,
Sir Griffin Markham, a Catholic gentleman, who for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
private reasons was discontented with the government,
and one Antony Copley. News of the plot
having reached the government, the conspirators fled
for their lives. Proclamations were issued for their
capture,<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> in which details were given of their personal
appearance. Thus Watson was described as a man
of the lowest sort about thirty-six years of age, "he
lookethe a squinte and is verie purblynde," and had
formerly worn a long beard which he was believed to
have cut off; whilst Sir Griffin Markham is credited
with having a large broad face of a "bleake"
complexion, a big nose, and a hand maimed by a
bullet. His brethren "have all verie greate noses."
Copley's description is not given, but we have that of
another conspirator, William Clarke, a priest, whose
hair is represented as having been "betwixte redd and
yeallowe." The whole party was subsequently taken,
one after another, and their examination disclosed
traces of another conspiracy, the object of which was
to place Arabella Stuart on the throne.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discovery of Watson's conspiracy—generally
known as the "Bye" or "Surprise" Plot—so alarmed
the king that he lost no time in making known his
intention to exact no longer the recusancy fines.
The result was such as might be expected. The
Puritans were disgusted, whilst the number of recusants
increased to such an alarming extent that in February,
1604, the king took the extreme measure of ordering
the expulsion of all Jesuits and Seminary priests from
the country before the 19th March,<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> the day fixed for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as parliament met a crisis was felt to be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With his customary self-complacency and patronising
air James told the assembled Commons that he
had brought them two gifts, the one peace abroad,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>

surprise and indignation when he found that neither
one nor the other was acceptable. The question of
the union of the two kingdoms, seeing that it involved
some political difficulties necessary of solution,
was referred to a commission.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> James showed his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
displeasure at the want of compliance displayed by
the Commons by refusing to accept a scheme of commutation
of his rights of purveyance and wardship,
which had now grown so burdensome.</p>

<a name="toc5" id="toc5"></a><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">Attempt to put down purveyance.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The abuse of purveyance, more especially, had
become a standing grievance to the burgesses of
London as well as of other cities and towns, in
spite of attempted remedies by statute or charter.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>
An offer of £50,000 a year was made to the king
by way of commuting any shred of right he might
still have to purveyance after thirty-six statutes had
pronounced it altogether illegal. This, however, he
refused, and the matter was allowed to drop. Two
years later, almost to the day (23 April, 1606), the
king endeavoured so far to remedy the evil as to
issue a proclamation against exactions and illegal
acts of his purveyors,<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> and yet scarcely a month
elapsed before the lord mayor had occasion to call
the attention of the lords of the council to the great
inconvenience caused in the city by their recent
demand for 200 carts with two horses to each, together
with the lord mayor's own barge, for the
purpose of conveying his majesty's effects to Greenwich.
As for the barge, the mayor wrote that the
lord chamberlain sometimes borrowed it for conveying
the king's guard, and it might haply be required again
for the same purpose, "but for carringe anie stuffe or
lugedge whereby it maie receave hurt it was never<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet required," and he hoped their lordships would
see the matter in that light.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another important matter which occupied the
attention of the House at this session—although no
reference to it appears in the City's records of the day—was
the introduction of Free Trade, to the prejudice
of the chartered rights of various trading companies.
The citizens of London were deeply interested in the
bill which was introduced for this purpose, for although
it little affected the livery companies, it touched very
closely the interests of those companies which were
incorporated for the purpose of trading with foreign
countries, such as that of the Merchant Adventurers,
the Levant Company, the Russia Company, and
others. These companies had been formed at a time
when few individuals were sufficiently wealthy to
bear the risk of distant enterprises. Not every
citizen was a Whitington or a Gresham. The risk
incurred by these associations in undertaking voyages
to distant countries was compensated by the advantage
gained by the enjoyment of a monopoly of the trade
with those countries by charter from the Crown. At
the outset there had been no cry raised against
monopolies of this kind, but as time wore on and the
merchant navy increased, as it did in the last reign
with extraordinary rapidity, a feeling of jealousy
grew up on the part of shipowners who were not
members of one or other of these chartered companies.
By the beginning of the seventeenth century dissatisfaction
with the privileges of these trading
companies had become so general that appeals were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made to the Privy Council. These being without
effect, the whole matter was referred to a parliamentary
committee. No pains were spared to get at
the root of the grievance. The committee were
attended by "a great concourse of clothiers and
merchants of all parts of the realm and especially of
London."<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> Counsel was heard in favour of the bill
which had been drafted for the purpose of throwing
open foreign trade to all merchants alike, and the
bill was supported by all the merchants attending
the committee with the exception of the merchants
of London, who were represented on the occasion by
the principal aldermen of the city. The free traders
urged the natural right of every one to the free
exercise of his own industry and the example set by
other nations. They declared that the passing of the
bill would lead to the more even distribution of
wealth,<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> the greater increase of shipping, and the
augmentation of the revenues of the Crown. The
upholders of the companies, on the other hand,
could find no better arguments in their favour than
that no company could be a monopoly inasmuch
as a monopoly was something granted exclusively
to a single individual, and that if the existence
of the companies was determined, apprenticeship
would cease and difficulties arise in collecting the
king's customs! After three days' debate on the
third reading the bill passed the Commons by a
large majority.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>  It met, however, with so much<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opposition in the House of Lords that it was eventually
dropt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A quarrel afterwards arose between the king and
the Commons on financial and ecclesiastical questions,
and matters being brought to a deadlock, the House
was adjourned (7 July). A few days before the
adjournment the Speaker and over a hundred members
held "a friendly and loving meeting" at Merchant
Taylors' Hall, before departing to their country homes.
The king contributed a buck and a hogshead of wine
towards the entertainment, which proved so popular
that thirty more guests appeared on the scene than
was originally intended. The "Solemn Feast" was
further graced by a "marchpane"—(a confection of
bitter almonds and sugar)—representing the House of
Commons sitting.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three years later (17 July, 1607) the king
himself honoured the company with his presence at
dinner in their hall. The Merchant Taylors would
gladly have welcomed him as one of their number
and admitted him to the honorary freedom of their
company, but James had already been made free of
the company of Clothworkers. His son, Prince
Henry, who was present at the entertainment, declared
himself willing to accept the freedom, and
made those of his suite who were not already members
of some other company follow his example.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a></p>

Common Council (23 Aug.) on the companies, according
to rates agreed upon at the time of the loan of
£20,000 to the late queen in 1598,<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> and it was to be
delivered to Sir Thomas Lowe, the treasurer of the

however, proved remiss in paying their quota.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The action of James in expelling the Jesuits and
Seminary priests had in the meantime so incensed the
Catholics that a plot was set on foot for blowing up
the king, the lords and commons, with gunpowder, as
soon as parliament should re-assemble. In May
(1604) a house had been hired by a Catholic named
Robert Catesby, through which access might be
gained to the basement of the parliament-house.
The party-wall, however, proved exceptionally thick,
and more than a year elapsed before the necessary
mining operations were complete. Catesby was
assisted in his work by a Spaniard named Guy
Fawkes, who assumed the name of John Johnson.
In the spring of 1605 the exasperation of the
Catholics was increased by James again imposing the
recusancy fines, and the little band of plotters
increased in numbers, although never allowed to
become large. The design of the conspirators was
rendered more easy of execution by the discovery
that a cellar reaching under the parliament-house
was to be let. This was hired by one of the plotters,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a large quantity of gunpowder was safely
deposited there and carefully concealed. After
several adjournments parliament was summoned to
assemble on the 5th November. On the eve of its
meeting Fawkes entered the cellar with a lantern,
ready to fire the train in the morning. One of the
conspirators, however, Tresham by name, had given
his friends some hint of the impending danger.
Fawkes was seized and committed to the Tower,
where he was subjected to the most horrible torture
by the king's orders.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> The rest of the conspirators,
with the exception of Winter, took immediate flight.
Hue and cry was raised,<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> and a personal description
of the leaders for their better identification was
scattered throughout the country. Winter was
described as "a man of meane stature, rather lowe
than otherwise, square made, somewhat stouping,
neere fortie yeares of age, his haire and beard
browne, his beard not much and his haire short";
Stephen Littleton, another conspirator, as "a verye
tall man, swarthy of complexion, of browne
coloured haire, no beard or litle, about thirty yeares
of age"; and Thomas Percy, another, as "a tall
man, with a great broad beard, a good face, the
colour of his beard and head mingled with white
heares, but stoupeth somewhat in the shoulders,
well coloured in the face, long-footed, small
legged."<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 8th November the mayor issued his
precept for bonfires to be lighted that evening in the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

of his fellow-conspirators as were taken alive were
brought to trial at Westminster, in January (1606), and
executed, some in St. Paul's Churchyard and others
before the parliament-house, their quarters being afterwards
placed on the city's gates, whilst their heads
were stuck up on London bridge.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> Pending their

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three Jesuits were implicated in the plot, their
names being John Gerrard, Oswald Greenway, and
Henry Garnet. Gerrard and Greenway effected their
escape, but Garnet was captured after having suffered
much deprivation whilst in hiding, and was brought
to trial at the Guildhall. Gerrard is described as tall
and well set up, but his complexion "swart or
blackish, his face large, his cheeks sticking out and
somewhat hollow underneath," his hair long unless
recently cut, his beard cut close, "saving littell
mustachoes and a littell tuft under his lower lippe,"
his age about forty. Equally precise descriptions are<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
given of Greenway and Garnet; the former being
represented as of "meane stature, somewhat grosse,"
his hair black, his beard bushy and brown, his forehead
broad, and his age about the same as that of
Gerrard; whilst Garnet is described as an older man,
between fifty and sixty years of age, of fair complexion,
full face and grisly hair, with a high forehead, and
corpulent.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> At his trial, which took place on the 28th
March, Garnet denied all knowledge of the plot save
what he had heard under the seal of confession. He
was nevertheless convicted and executed (3 May) in
St. Paul's Churchyard.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In July of this year (1606) the king of Denmark
arrived in England on a visit to his brother-in-law, king
James. The mayor, being informed by the lords of
the council that the Danish fleet was already in the
Thames, summoned a Common Council (17 July) to
consider what steps should be taken to give the royal
visitor a befitting reception in the city. A committee
was thereupon appointed to make the necessary preparations.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>
They had but a fortnight before them for
contriving a pageant, cleansing the streets, setting up
rails and executing the thousand little things which
always require to be done on such occasions.
The sum of £1,000 was raised by the livery companies,<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>
and each alderman was directed to see that
the inhabitants of his ward hung out suitable tapestry
from houses on the line of procession. The distinguished
visitor was presented with a gold cup taken
from the king's jewel-house in the Tower. It weighed
62-3/4 ozs., and the City paid for it at the rate of £3 10<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

general rejoicing in the city, and that was the presence
of the plague. This necessitated special precautions
being taken to prevent the spread of infection, and
an additional number of wardens were appointed to
take their stand, halberd in hand, at the doors of
infected houses on the day of the king's visit to
prevent anyone going in or coming out.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the chief cause of the city being so often
visited by epidemics in former days was the lack of
a plentiful supply of wholesome water will scarcely
be denied. When we consider with what rapidity
the population of the city increased, more especially
under the Tudors, the short-sighted policy of a government
which forbade the erection of new buildings
within three miles of the city's gates,<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> and drove
so many families to find shelter under one roof within
the limited area of the city proper, in spite of proclamations
to the contrary,<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> the want of any organised
system of drainage, and the scanty supply of water—we
can only marvel that the city was ever free from
epidemics.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1543 the municipal authorities obtained
statutory powers to amend decayed conduits and
erect new ones, as well as to bring water to the
city from Hampstead,<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> and from that time they
appear to have taken a more active interest in the
water supply. They made periodical visits to the
various conduits, and more especially the conduit-head<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at Marylebone, where a banqueting-house was erected
for their convenience. Nevertheless they preferred
encouraging private individuals (and these not infrequently
foreigners) in attempts to improve the city's
water supply, as necessity arose, to undertaking the
work themselves in their corporate capacity. In 1570
the City acquired parliamentary powers to break soil
for the purpose of conveying water from the river Lea,
"otherwise called Ware River," at any time <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within
the next ten years</span></em>,<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> but these powers were allowed to
lapse by default. In 1581 Peter Morice, a Dutchman,
obtained permission to set up a water-mill in the Thames
at London Bridge, and by some mechanical contrivance—a
"most artificial forcier"—succeeded in conveying
water as far as Leadenhall and Gracechurch. The
civic authorities were so pleased with the result of his
first efforts that they assisted him with a loan of
£1,000 to perfect his work.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> Ten years later (1591)
the famous Italian engineer—of "fire-ship" fame—Frederico
Gianibelli obtained the consent of the Court
of Aldermen to erect new water-works at Tyburn for
the purpose of providing the city with a better
supply.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> In 1593 Beavis Bulmer, another foreigner (to
judge from his name), obtained a lease for 500 years
permitting him to set up an engine at Broken Wharf
for the purpose of supplying water to the inhabitants
of the city. The Court of Aldermen granted him
the use of the green-yard at Leadenhall for putting
together his engine, whilst the court of Common<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Council advanced him the sum of £1,000 on easy
terms.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> Soon after the granting of Bulmer's lease
the Common Council conceded to Henry Shaw a
right to convey water from Fogwell pond, Smithfield,
and to supply it to anyone willing to pay him for it,
for a similar term of 500 years.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length a scheme was started at the opening of
the seventeenth century which not only proved itself
equal to the task of supplying the ever-increasing
population of London with an adequate supply of
water, but was destined in after years to render its
undertakers rich "beyond the dreams of avarice."
The New River Company, the original shares of
which are of almost fabulous value at the present
day, had its commencement in an Act of Parliament
(3 James I, c. 18) which empowered the mayor,
commonalty and citizens of London and their
successors at any time to make an open trench<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> for
the purpose of bringing a fresh stream of running
water to the north parts of the city from springs at
Chadwell and Amwell, co. Herts. Whilst showing
themselves ready and anxious to render the city
more healthy and less subject to epidemics by cleansing
the city's ditches of all filth and draining
Finsbury and the Moorfields,<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> the civic authorities
were appalled at the enormity of their own proposals,
and hesitated to carry out what at that time<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appeared to be an engineering task of stupendous
difficulty. Three years elapsed and nothing was
done. Offers were made by various individuals to
execute the work for them, but these were declined.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>
At length, on the 28th March, 1609, Hugh Middleton,
a goldsmith of London, but of Welsh extraction,
declared himself ready to undertake the work and to
complete it within four years. His offer was accepted,
and an agreement was drawn up and executed on the
21st April.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding the lords of the council having
been desired by the lord mayor to instruct the Justices
of the Peace of Hertfordshire and Middlesex to assist
Middleton and his men in carrying out their work,<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>
the undertaking met with great opposition. Among
the various objections raised to the New River
scheme was one to the effect that the municipal
authorities had done nothing in the business themselves,
but had by Act of Common Council irrevocably
conveyed their whole interest in fee simple to
Middleton, who was carrying out the work "for his
own private benefit." To this objection answer was
made that if the mayor and citizens would not
adventure upon so uncertain a work Middleton
deserved the greater commendation in adventuring
his money and labour for the good of the city,
and if the city was benefited and the country not<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

A bill was introduced into parliament to repeal the
Acts authorising the construction of the New River,
and a committee appointed (20 June, 1610) to survey
the damages caused or likely to be caused by the
work,<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> and report thereon to the House. "Much
ado there is also in the House," wrote a contemporary
to his friend,<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> "about the work undertaken and far
advanced already by Middleton, of the cutting
of a river and bringing it to London from ten or
twelve miles off, through the grounds of many
men who, for their particular interest, do strongly
oppose themselves to it, and are like (as 'tis said)
to overthrow it all." The bill was opposed by
the City. A deputation consisting of two aldermen,
the Town Clerk and the City Remembrancer
was appointed (25 May, 1610) to wait upon Sir
John Herbert, one of the principal Secretaries of
State, Sir Julius Cæsar, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and other influential members of parliament, for the
purpose of entreating them to use their efforts to
prevent the repeal of the statutes on the ground that
the stream of fresh water which would thereby be
brought to the north parts of the city would tend
to the preservation of health; that the work had
already been carried ten miles, and that Middleton
had already expended more than £3,000 in carrying
it out.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Middleton was eventually allowed to proceed
with his work, but the delay that had taken place
made it necessary for him to apply to the Common
Council for an extension of time within which to
complete it. The City readily consented to grant
him an extension of five years (27 Feb., 1611).<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> No
application for pecuniary assistance however appears
to have been made to the City at this or any other
time whilst the work was in progress by Middleton,
although he lacked funds and was compelled in the
following year to seek the assistance of James
himself. The king was familiar with Middleton
and his undertaking, for the New River was carried past
his own hunting-lodge of Theobalds. In May (1612)
he agreed to pay half the cost of the whole work on
condition that Middleton would convey to him one-half
of the property. Middleton could not do otherwise
than accept the king's offer, and in the following

(29 Sept., 1613) that Thomas,<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> his elder brother,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even then the whole enterprise might have failed
had not pressure been brought to bear to make the
inhabitants of the city use the New River water to the
exclusion of other supplies. In 1616, three years
after the New River had been opened, the lords of the
council wrote (23 Dec.) to the mayor and aldermen
informing them that it was the king's wish that, inasmuch
as few persons used the new supply, the city
authorities should see that all such houses as could
conveniently use it should be made to use it, for it was
not to be supposed, said they, that two Acts of
Parliament and an Act of Common Council affecting
the health and safety of the city should be passed to
no other purpose than to injure those who undertook
so useful a work on the part of the city.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> So again,
in the following year (1617), when the brewers of
London wished to erect waterworks on their own
account at Dowgate, they were stopped by order of
the Privy Council, and told to take their water from
the New River, which had been made at great expense,
"was of great consequence to his majesty's service, and
deserved all due encouragement."<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> Even the civic

injuring the interests of the shareholders of the New

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after the completion of the New River,
Middleton applied to the City for a loan. The whole
of his own capital had been sunk in his vast undertaking,
and he required an advance of £3,000. The
loan was granted (8 Sept., 1614) for three years at six
per cent., security being given by his brother Thomas,
the lord mayor, Robert, another brother, and Robert
Bateman.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1622 (19 Oct.) James conferred on Middleton
a baronetcy—a new hereditary title recently established

been too poor to pay the sum of £1,000 or so for which
the new title was purchasable; at any rate the money
was not exacted.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> A baronet in the city of London
(by the way) enjoyed the special privilege of exemption

to the lord mayor (11 Nov., 1613), "that a gentleman
called to the quality of a baronet should be
afterwards called to be sheriff," and he declared that
he would have "no such precedent."<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A year after Middleton had been created a
baronet the Court of Aldermen voted him (13 Nov.,
1623) a gold chain of the value of 200 marks in
recognition of his services in supplying the city with
water, and thereby preventing the spread of disastrous
fires.  Only the night before (12 Nov.) "a very<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
terrible and fearful fire" had broken out, destroying
many houses, and among them that of Sir William
Cockaine, in Broad Street, and causing damage to the
extent of £40,000 and more;<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> and the Court of
Aldermen, in recording their vote, testified to the
great danger which would have threatened the city
had not a plentiful supply of water, thanks to
Middleton, been at hand.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> The chain was set with

allowed to supervise the making of it.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this time the City's loan to Middleton remained
outstanding, and indeed it remained unrepaid
at the time of his death in December, 1631, a
circumstance which shows that the greatest engineer
of the age died worse off than many believe.
After considerable hesitation the Court of Aldermen
instructed the City Solicitor to recover the money by
suing on Middleton's bond.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If other evidence were wanting to show that
Middleton died in reduced circumstances there is
the fact that his widow was compelled, soon
after her husband's death, to seek satisfaction from
the City for losses sustained by his estate by means of
"many breaches made in the pipes of water and
otherwise upon occasion of divers great fires." After
considering the matter for close upon two years
the Common Council at length agreed (2 Oct., 1634)
to raise a sum of £1,000 for her by assessment on the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wards, but hesitated whether to pay the money to
Lady Middleton for her own use or as executrix only
of the will of her late husband, "to be distributed
according to the custome of this Citty whereof he
dyed a Freeman." The court added this condition
to the gift, viz.: that the City should be allowed to
set up cocks in connection with the New River pipes
in each ward, to be used in cases of fire, in place of
cutting the pipes, as had been the custom on such
occasions.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> In 1635 Middleton's loan remained still
owing to the City, and the £1,000 promised to his
widow was not yet collected. On the 12th May
Lady Middleton petitioned the Court of Aldermen to
allow the £1,000 to be accepted in part payment of
her late husband's debt and she would endeavour
forthwith to discharge the remainder. To this the
court acceded.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1726 the New River Company petitioned the
Common Council for a direct conveyance to be made to
the company of all the statutory rights and privileges
the City had originally made over to Middleton. The
reason given for this request was that the company
found themselves obliged at the time to prosecute a
number of trespassers, and that it had been advised
by counsel that in order to get a verdict in the
company's favour it would have to prove its title,
"through all times and through all the mean conveyances,"
from the passing of the original Act of
Parliament to the present time. The company
represented that such a proceeding would involve
enormous difficulty, but this difficulty could be
got over if the City would consent to give an<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
immediate grant to the company of all that they had
formerly conveyed to Middleton, and upon the same
terms. The matter, urged the company, was one
that affected the interests of the City, for unless the
offenders were punished the water of the New River
would continue to be intercepted before it reached
the city. The petition was referred to the City
Lands Committee for consideration.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just at the time when the City was meditating
a transfer of their powers under the New River Acts
to Middleton, a scheme was being set on foot for
colonising a vast tract of land in the north of Ireland,
which, after the flight of the earls of Tyrone and
Tyrconnel in 1607, was declared to be confiscated to
the Crown. In October, 1608, commissioners had
been appointed to draw up a plan for the proposed
colonisation, or, as it was called, the "Plantation of
Ulster," and by the following January (1609) their
reports were sent in.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> The next step was the
formulating of orders and conditions to be observed
by the undertakers of the plantation, and by
the end of January these were ready, although
they do not appear to have been published before
the following March.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> The object of promulgating
these orders and conditions was to attract persons
to take a share in the work of the plantation,
not so much with the view of benefiting themselves
as of doing service to the Crown and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
commonwealth. Whatever attraction the scheme as
put forth in this Collection of Orders and Conditions—often
referred to in subsequent proceedings as the
"printed book"—may have had for others, it had none
for the Londoner.<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> The city merchant and trader
required to be assured of some substantial benefit to
be gained by himself before he would embark in any
such undertaking, and in order to give him this
assurance he was asked to consider a long list of
"motives and reasons to induce the City of London
to undertake plantation in the north of Ireland."<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this document, bearing date the 28th May,
1609, the king offered to make over to the city of
London the city of Derry and another place near
the castle of Coleraine with adjacent territory, and
with exceptional advantages as to custom dues and
admiralty jurisdiction. As an inducement to accept
the king's offer the citizens were assured that the
country was well watered and suitable for breeding
cattle; it grew hemp and flax better than elsewhere;
it was well stocked with game and had excellent sea
and river fisheries, and it contained such abundance
of provisions as not only to supply the plantation,
but also assist towards the relief of the London poor.
Besides these advantages the city, which was so
overcrowded "that one tradesman was scarcely able
to live by another," would have an opportunity of
getting rid of some of its surplus population, and at
the same time render itself less liable to infectious
diseases. If the citizens wanted a precedent for what<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they were now called upon to undertake, they were
invited to look at what Bristol had done for Dublin
in the reign of Henry II. The plantation of Dublin
by Bristol, which reflected "eternal commendation"
on the latter city, had done much towards civilising and
securing that part of Ireland, and it was greatly to be
hoped that the precedent so set would now be followed
by London, more especially as the advantages to be
gained were far greater.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">The matter laid before a special Court of Aldermen, 1 July, 1609.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A goodly prospect indeed; but still the enterprise
failed to commend itself to the Londoner. A
month went by and nothing was done. At length,
on Saturday, the 1st July, the matter was brought
direct to the attention of a special Court of Aldermen
and "divers selected comoners" of the city by the
lords of the council. Again the citizens were assured
that by taking a part in the work of the plantation
they would not only be doing a work acceptable unto
God but one which would be at once honourable and
profitable to themselves.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">Referred to the livery companies.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The project was received with favour to the
extent that it was resolved to invite the livery
companies to consider the matter, and to appoint
committees to make suggestions to the court in
writing by the following Wednesday (5 July),<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> and
precepts to the companies were issued accordingly.
The reply sent by the companies appears to have
been considered unsatisfactory, for on the following
Saturday (8 July) the mayor issued another precept
rebuking them for the attitude taken up by their
representatives, who had not, in his opinion, paid<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sufficient attention to the matter nor fully realised
the motives and reasons which had been propounded.
He bade them reconsider the matter and send their
representatives to the Guildhall on Friday, 14th July,
with "such reasons and demands as are fit to be
remembered, required or considered of in the undertaking
of so great and honourable an action" set
down in writing.<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> Accordingly, on the 14th, the
committees of the various companies appeared before
the Court of Aldermen with their answer in writing,
and a deputation was nominated to carry their answer
to the lords and to hear anything more that they
might have to say on the matter.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lords of the council being angry with the
companies for sending in their answer before a conference
had been held with them, the Recorder was
instructed to inform them that the companies had
acted under a mistake, and intended nothing undutiful
in what they had done, and a deputation was again
nominated to confer with their lordships.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a> This was
on Tuesday, the 18th July.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">A conference with the lords of the council.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the end of the week "a full and large
conference" took place, and the lords of the council
so satisfied the representatives of the companies of
the profitable nature of the undertaking that they
were encouraged to become adventurers. It was an<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
understood thing between the parties that the citizens
should send their own representatives over to Ireland
to view the property, and if the undertaking proved to
be otherwise than had been represented, and unprofitable,
they were to be at liberty to withdraw from it
altogether. The result of the conference was signified
to the masters and wardens of the several companies
on Monday, the 24th July, by precept of the mayor,
who enjoined them to call together their companies on
the following Wednesday, and after explaining the
whole matter to them, to learn from each individual
member what amount he was prepared to contribute
towards the furtherance of so "famous a project," and
to cause the same to be entered in a book "to the intent
his majesty may be informed of the readiness of this
city in a matter of such great consequence." A
note was to be made of any who refused to contribute,
and those who failed to attend the summons were to
be fined. No time was to be lost, for the lords of the
council expected a return of the amount to be contributed
by the companies by Friday (28 July).<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Sunday, the 30th July, a deputation of
aldermen and commoners again waited on the lords
of the council, and received permission to elect four
wise, grave and discreet citizens to cross over to
Ireland and view the proposed plantation. On Tuesday
(1 Aug.) the Common Council nominated John
Broad, goldsmith, Hugh Hamersley, haberdasher,
Robert Treswell, painter-stainer, and John Rowley,
draper, to be the City's commissioners for the purpose.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lords of the council anticipated the arrival
of the City's agents in Ireland by directing Sir
Thomas Philips to accompany them in their travels,
and by sending instructions to Sir Arthur Chichester,
the deputy, to see that they were well supplied
with necessaries and were assisted in every way.
The latter was more particularly instructed to use
great care in the selection of discreet persons to
conduct and accompany them, men who from their
experience and understanding might be able, "both
by discourse and reason, to controule whatsoever
any man shall reporte either out of ignorance or
malice, and to give the undertakors satisfaccon
when they shalbe mistaken or not well informed of
any particular."<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> The conductors were to take
care to lead the Londoners by the best roads, and to
lodge them on their journeys where they might, if
possible, receive English entertainment in Englishmen's
houses. The lords of the council at the same
time forwarded to Sir Arthur Chichester a copy of the
"Project," and desired him to see that those who
conducted the City's agents were "well prepared
before-hand to confirme and strengthen every part
thereof by demonstracon as they may plainly
apprehend and conceive the commodities to be of
good use and profit." On the other hand, matters
of distaste, such as fear of the Irish, of the soldiers,
of cess and such like must not be so much as
named. These could be set right afterwards and
were only matters of discipline and order. Lastly,
if the Londoners should happen to express a wish<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
respecting anything, "whether it be the fishing, the
admirallty, or any other particuler w<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ch</span></span> may serve
for a motyve to enduce them," the same was
to be conceded at once, and no private interests,
whether of Sir Arthur Chichester himself or any
other individual, were to be allowed to stand in
the way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These instructions were carried out to the letter,
and the City's representatives, as soon as they set foot
in Ireland, were treated right royally. Sir John Davys,
one of the king's commissioners engaged in surveying
the country, wrote home on the 28th August<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>: "The
Londoners are now come, and exceeding welcome
to us. Wee all use our best rhetorick to persuade
them to go on w<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> their plantation, w<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ch</span></span> will assure
the whole island to the crowne of England forever.
They like and praise the cuntrey very much,
specially the Banne and the river of Loghfoyle."
He goes on to say that one of the City's agents had
fallen sick, and would have returned, but the lord-deputy
and the rest had used every means to comfort
and retain him, "lest this accident shold discourage
his fellow cittizens." In other respects, too, they saw
the country at its best, for they arrived at a time when
the Irish were flocking in and making their submission
in far better fashion than they had done for years. So
pleased were they with what they saw that they assured
Sir Arthur Chichester that the City would certainly
undertake the plantation upon the report they were
about to make. The deputy on his part assured
them that if the Londoners did not undertake the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
work they would be enemies to themselves. He
suggested that they should send home to the lord
mayor some samples of the commodities of the
country. The suggestion was adopted, and he
obtained for them some raw hides, tallow, salmon,
herrings, eels, pipe-staves, beef and the like at a
cheap rate. He also procured them some iron ore
and promised to furnish them with samples of lead
and copper.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By November the City's agents had returned to
London. On the 28th they appeared before the
Court of Aldermen and presented their report,
together with an answer made by Sir Arthur
Chichester to certain questions they had put to him
on doubtful points, and also a map or "plott" of the
country they had viewed. The court in the first
place authorised the Chamberlain to re-imburse them
the sum of £100 which they had found it necessary
to borrow to supplement the allowance of £300
originally allowed for their expenses by the court;<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a>
and in the next gave orders for all the documents

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Friday, the 15th, the committee were ready
with their report. They had met five times, and had
held long debate and consultation on the various
matters incident to "so great a business," and on
each and all of these they had something to say. As
to the financial part of the undertaking they were of
opinion that the Common Council should pass an Act
for raising a sum of £15,000, and no more, upon the
members of the wealthier livery companies, by poll,
the inferior companies being spared. The report
having been approved by the court a deputation was
appointed to wait upon the Privy Council with the
City's answer on the following Sunday (17 December).<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the lords of the council came to consider
the City's proposals they found much to their liking,
but the clause which restricted the amount of money
to be furnished by the City to £15,000, and no more,
was "much distasted" by them, seeing that that sum
would scarcely suffice to buy up private interests, let
alone the work of plantation. The City's offer in
this respect was therefore rejected, and the Common
Council had therefore to increase its offer to £20,000.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in the following year (8 Jan., 1610) a
committee was appointed, including the four commissioners
who had viewed the plantation, to confer
with commissioners appointed by the Privy Council
as to the best means of carrying out the work. In
the meantime the sum of £5,000, or one-fourth part
of the £20,000 required, was to be immediately levied<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the principal companies according to their corn

unfairness of assessing them according to the existing
corn rate, inasmuch as a great change had taken
place since that rate had been made: "Divers companies
are decayed and others growne to bee of
greater liability, so as particuler men of some
companies are now exceedinglie overcharged and
others greatelye favoured." It was too late to
make any alteration in the payment of the first two
instalments, as the plantation was to commence in the
summer,<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> but a new assessment for corn was made
in July with the view of making the rate more
equitable.<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 28th January (1610) the committee
appointed by the court of Common Council came to
terms with the Privy Council, and a special agreement
was signed by both parties embodying all the essential
conditions of the plantation in twenty-seven articles.
A period of seven years was allowed the City to make
such other reasonable demands as time might show to
be needful.<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The articles were read at the Common Council
held two days later (30 Jan.), when it was decided<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to form a company in the city of London for
the purpose of carrying out the plantation, the
company to consist of a governor, a deputy-governor
and twenty-four assistants, of whom the Recorder of
the city was to be one. The governor and five of the
assistants were to be aldermen of the city, the rest
commoners.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> On the 4th February the lords of the
council informed Sir Arthur Chichester that the "noble
and worthy work of the plantation in Ulster undertaken
by the city" was concluded, and the articles
signed. The city had chosen a governor and a council
of assistants for the more orderly disposition of their
affairs. They had also elected John Rowley to be
their agent, and he and others would shortly set out
for Ireland. The lords commended him to the deputy's
care, and he was instructed to see that they were
furnished with a sufficient number of labourers for
felling timber, digging stone and burning lime. Sir
Arthur's services in forwarding a work which the
king had so much at heart would not go, they assured
him, unrewarded.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The articles of the plantation had not long been
signed before the government broke faith with the
City, and the latter were asked to forego no less than
2,000 acres of land agreed to be assigned to them. This
iniquitous proposal on the part of the king's commissioners
was laid before a special court of Common
Council (7 June, 1610) by Alderman Cockaine, the
governor of the Irish Society. After long deliberation
the court decided to stand upon their rights, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rejected the proposal. Six weeks later (22 July)
they saw fit to change their minds, and they agreed
to surrender the 2,000 acres whilst refusing to accede
to other demands.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was no easy task the City had undertaken.
Great difficulty was experienced in getting the companies
to pay up their quota of the £20,000 to be
raised for the purpose of the plantation. The
wardens of the Mercers, the Clothworkers and other
companies were committed to prison by order of the
Court of Aldermen for refusing or failing to pay the
sums at which their respective companies had been
assessed.<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> The masters or wardens of the companies
were not so much to blame as the individual members
of the companies who refused to pay. Thus, a sum of
£200 due from Sir John Spencer, the rich Clothworker,
remained unpaid at his death. It was eventually
paid by his son-in-law, Lord Compton, after much
solicitation.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> Even when the money was got in there
was a difficulty in forwarding it to its destination, so
infested was the Irish coast with pirates who lay in
wait for the money sent by the City for the works at
Coleraine.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in the following year (31 Jan., 1611) the
livery companies were called upon to certify to the
Irish Society, within one week, whether or no they
were willing to accept an allotment of the Irish estate
proportionate to the money by them advanced, and to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cultivate and plant the same at their own cost and
charges, according to the "printed book" of the
plantation, or leave the letting and disposing thereof
to the governor and committees. They were warned
that, in any case, they would still have to contribute
towards the charge of building houses and fortifications
and freeing of tithes.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> In response to the
mayor's precept eight of the principal companies of
the city, viz., the Mercers, Grocers, Drapers,
Fishmongers, Goldsmiths, Salters, Ironmongers and
Vintners, and ten of the inferior companies, viz., the
Dyers, Pewterers, Founders, Whitebakers, Broderers,
Armourers, Tilers and Bricklayers, Blacksmiths,
Weavers and Woodmongers, signified their willingness
to accept a proportionate part of the land (27 Feb.).
The remainder of the companies preferred to leave
the lands alone, but they were allowed to come in
afterwards if they saw reason to change their mind.<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By July (1611) nearly the whole of the £20,000
had been expended. The Common Council thereupon
resolved that a further sum of £10,000 should be
levied on the companies at the same rate as the last
two payments. A day was appointed for the companies
to send in a written notice whether they agreed
to contribute to this fresh sum or were ready to forfeit
the money they had already subscribed and lose all
their right in the plantation.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>. £5,000 was to be ready

out by one side only. The City had found the money
wherewith to carry out the work of the plantation,
but as yet not an acre of land had been assigned. It
is not surprising, therefore, that when the Grocers'
Company were called upon to contribute their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quota</span></em>
to the £5,000 demanded in July, 1612, they desired
the lord mayor not to press the matter until the

Council found itself under the unpleasant necessity of
asking the companies for another £10,000 within a
few weeks of the incorporation of the Irish Society.
Not only had the whole of the £30,000 formerly
subscribed been expended, but the Irish Society had
borrowed £3,000 from the Chamber of London.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James had already begun to show impatience—even
before the granting of the charter of incorporation
to the Irish Society—at the little progress made in the
work of the plantation. At the close of the last year
(21 Dec., 1612) he had himself written to Sir Arthur
Chichester directing him to send home an account of
what the Londoners had done; for, notwithstanding
their pretence of great expenditure, there was, so he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was informed, little outward show for it.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> Fault was
found with them, not only for failing to build houses

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Midsummer-day (1613) Sir Henry Montague,
the Recorder, and Sir William Cockaine, the governor
of the Irish Society, signified to the Common Council
that it was the king's wish that the walls and
fortifications of Derry should be at once taken in
hand. The court agreed to lose no time in carrying
out the king's wishes, and further resolved to despatch
"some great and worthy magistrate," as well as
"some commoner of special countenance and credit,"
to take an exact notice, view and account of the whole
work of the plantation, and of all works done and to
be done, and, in a word, to do all that they deemed
necessary for the good of the plantation. The choice
of the court fell upon Alderman George Smithes and
Matthias Springham, a Merchant Taylor.<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a></p>

report was submitted to the Common Council on the
8th November (1613). Among other things they had
taken great pains to make an equal division of the land
as far as was possible into twelve parts, with the view of
distributing it among the livery companies as proposed,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a "plott" of the division was laid before the
court. But they were of opinion that the city of
Londonderry and its land of 4,000 acres, and the town
of Coleraine with its 3,000 acres, its ferries and fisheries,
could not be conveniently divided, but the rents and
profits of them might be divided among the several
companies. As to the fortification of Derry, the
commissioners had consulted ten military experts on
the matter and plans had been drafted; but it was
necessary to gather material before the wall could
be commenced, and this the commissioners recommended
should be taken in hand at once.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 17th December lots were publicly drawn
to decide the particular lands which each of the

of their property so far as they could do so; but
livery of seisin was not and could not be made to
them until James had granted (30 Sep., 1615), both
to the Irish Society and to the companies, a licence in
mortmain. This licence was expressly granted "to
the end that they might be the better encouraged and
enabled to proceed and finish the same plantation,
and in future times reap some gains and benefits
of their great travails and expenses bestowed
therein."<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> It may be inferred from this that

would reap much gain or profit from their enterprise

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In years gone by, when some of the companies
sold their Irish estate, there was no question as to
their power of alienation or their absolute right to the
proceeds of the sale, but of late years a cry has been
raised that the companies held their estates in a
fiduciary capacity, and that they could not legally
alienate their Irish property without accounting for
the proceeds of the sale as public trustees. It had got
abroad that those companies who had not already
parted with their Irish estates—as the Haberdashers
had done as far back as the year 1675, and the Merchant
Taylors, the Goldsmiths and the Vintners,
between the years 1728 and 1737—were meditating a
sale. In response to the cry thus raised a select
Parliamentary Committee was appointed to enquire
"as to the Terms of the Charters or other Instruments<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by which their Estates in Ireland were granted to
the Irish Society and to the London companies, and
as to the Trusts and Obligations (if any) attaching
to the Ownership of such Estates." Any trust or
obligation in connection with the tenure of these
estates would naturally be comprised within the four
corners of the charters and instruments mentioned in
the order of reference just cited, but these the committee
practically ignored, on the ground that the
task of pronouncing with decisive authority upon their
legal construction could only be performed by a
judicial tribunal.<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> We have it, however, on the
authority of so sound a lawyer as the late Sir George
Jessel, that the companies are ordinary owners of
their Irish estates in fee simple, subject only to the
reservations expressly contained in the conveyance to
them.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Contemporaneously with the plantation of
Ulster, another and more distant enterprise of somewhat
similar character was being carried out in
America; and to this, as to every great public
undertaking, the citizens of London must need be
called to lend their assistance. A company formed
in 1606, and composed, in part at least, of London
merchants, the object of which was the colonisation
of Virginia, had proved a failure after a hopeless
struggle for three years. It was therefore determined
to reconstruct the company on a different
basis and to make an entirely fresh start.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the spring of 1609 the company wrote to
Sir Humphrey Weld,<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> then mayor of London, for
assistance in financing the undertaking, urging him at
the same time to diminish the risk of pestilence and
famine in the city by removing the surplus population
to Virginia. For the sake of convenience they
purposed to issue no bills of adventure for less than
£12 10<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span>, but if his lordship were to make any
"ceasement" (assessment) or raise subscriptions from<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the best disposed and most able of the companies, the
council and company of the plantation would be
willing to give bills of adventure to the masters and
wardens for the general use and behoof of each
company, or in the case of subscription by the wards
to the alderman and deputy of each ward for the
benefit of the ward. Should the emigrants "demaund
what may be theire present mayntenaunce, what
maye be theire future hopes?" they might be told
that the company was for the present prepared to
offer them "meate, drinke and clothing, with an
howse, orchard and garden for the meanest family,
and a possession of lands to them and their posterity."
Any alderman of the city subscribing £50 would be
reckoned as an original member of the council of the
company, and take equal share of the profits with the
rest; their deputies, too, would be admitted to the
same privileges on payment of half that sum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In response to a precept no less than fifty-six
companies agreed to take ventures in the plantation.
The Grocers subscribed the sum of £487 10<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span>, or more
than double the amount subscribed by any other
company. The Mercers, the Goldsmiths and the
Merchant Taylors contributed respectively the next
highest amount, viz., £200; whilst the Drapers and
Fishmongers subscribed severally £150, the Stationers
£125, the Clothworkers £100, and the Salters £50.
In addition to these contributions made by the
companies in their corporate capacity other sums
were ventured by individual members.<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> Bills of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the assistance thus afforded by the citizens
of London the Virginia Company had no difficulty in
obtaining another charter from the Crown (23 May,
1609). Among the adventurers to whom the charter
was granted, and who embraced representatives of
every rank, profession and occupation, we find
Humphrey Weld, the mayor, whose name immediately
follows those of the peers of the realm who
shared in the undertaking, and Nicholas Ferrar,
skinner, who died in 1620, and gave by will "£300 to
the college in Virginia, to be paid when there shall
be ten of the infidels' children placed in it, and in the
meantime twenty-four pounds by the yeare to be
disbursed unto three discreete and godly men in the
colonie, which shall honestly bring up three of the
infidels' children in Christian religion and some good
course to live by."<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime (15 May) seven vessels with
emigrants on board had set sail from Woolwich.
After frequent delays on the south coast of England
they crossed the Atlantic and reached their destination<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the 11th August. Yellow fever had unfortunately
broken out on board ship during the long voyage,
and this, together with the plague, which is generally
believed to have been conveyed to Virginia by the
fleet, committed great havoc among the early emigrants.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not long before more money was wanted,
and again application was made to the livery companies.
The Mercers declined to make any further
advance;<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> but with the assistance of the other companies
the sum of £5,000 was raised, which was
afterwards increased to £18,000.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> Nevertheless, in
spite of every exertion, the company was in the
autumn of 1611 on the very verge of ruin, and
something had to be done to prevent its utter collapse.
It was accordingly again re-constructed, its domains
were made to comprise the Bermudas, or Somers
Islands, and a third charter granted (12 March, 1612),
in which a number of citizens are named as having
become adventurers since the last letters patent.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A special feature of the charter was the authorisation
of one or more lottery or lotteries to be held for
the benefit of the company,<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> by virtue of which a
lottery was soon afterwards opened in London. The
chief prize fell to one Thomas Sharplys, or Sharplisse,
a tailor of London, who won "four thousand crowns
in fair plate."<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> The lucky winner used the same

on the matter of this lottery, but we learn from
other sources that the Grocers' Company adventured
the sum of £62 10<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> of their common goods and drew
a prize of £13 10<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> An offer being made to them to
accept the prize subject to a rebate of £10, or in lieu
thereof "a faire rounde salt with a cover of silver
all gilt," weighing over 44 ozs. at 6<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 7<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span> per oz.,
amounting to the sum of £14 19<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 1<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>, the company
resolved to accept the salt, "both in respect it would
not be so much losse to the company ... and
alsoe in regard this company wants salts." The
balance of £1 9<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> was ordered to be paid out of the
common goods of the company.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> Not only the companies
but several of the city parishes had ventures
in a small way in the lottery. Thus the vestry of
St. Mary Colechurch agreed (7 June) to adventure
the sum of £6 of the church stock, whereby the
church was the gainer of "twoe spones, price twenty
shillinge."<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> The parish of St. Mary Woolchurch
adventured a less sum, taking only fifty lots at a
shilling apiece, in return for which it got a prize
of ten shillings.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> That the lottery was not taken
up in the way it was hoped it would be is shown
by the fact that just before the drawing—which
took place in a house at the west end of St. Paul's,
and lasted from the 29th June till the 20th July—no
less than 60,000 blanks were taken out, in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
order to increase the number of chances in favour
of the adventurers.<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two years later (1614) another lottery for the
same purpose was set on foot. On the 1st April the
lords of the council addressed a circular letter to the
city companies,<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a> enclosing a copy of a pamphlet by
Sir Thomas Smith, entitled "A declaration of the
present estate of the English in Virginia, with the
final resolucon of the Great Lotterye intended for
their supply," and exhorting them to do their best
to make the lottery a success. The object is there
described as a "worthy and Christian enterprise, full of
honour and profitt to His Majestie and the whole
realme." A copy of this letter was forwarded to
the several companies through Sir Thomas Middleton,
the mayor,<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a> who, as we have already said, was himself
a member of the Council of the Virginia Company in
1609. The lotteries, however, found but little favour
with the companies, who were actively engaged at
the time in managing their recently acquired Irish
estates, and had but little money to spare. The
Merchant Taylors' Company contented themselves
with voting only £50 out of their common stock for
the lottery, leaving it to individual members to venture
further sums on their own account as each might
think fit.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> The Grocers' Company, of which
Middleton was a member, voted nothing out of their<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
common stock, but each member was exhorted "for
the general advancement of Christianity and good of
the commonwealth," to write with his own hands
how much he was willing to venture. This was
accordingly done (15 April), the lord mayor himself
setting the example; but as to the result the
company's records fail to give any information.<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prospects of the Virginia Company were
seriously imperilled by an ill-advised speech made in
the House of Commons by the lord mayor inveighing
against the importation of tobacco. The Company
was already in disgrace with the House, through
the indiscretion of Counsel employed to prosecute a
petition on its behalf, and all the members of the
Company who held seats in the House were desired
to withdraw until it should be decided what action
should be taken in the matter. Eventually peace was
restored by the offending Counsel coming to the Bar of
the House and making a humble submission.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1618 a scheme was set on foot for taking up
vagrant boys and girls that lay begging in the streets
of the city, having neither home nor friends, and
transporting them to Virginia to be there industriously
employed. The scheme came before the Court of
Common Council on the 31st July in the form of a
petition from a number of citizens. A committee
was at once appointed to consider the matter, and
on the 24th September they brought in their report.<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>
The Virginia Company had agreed to take 100 boys<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and girls between the ages of eight and sixteen, and
to educate and bring them up at the company's
charge. The company were prepared, moreover,
to give each boy and girl fifty acres of land, to each
boy as soon as he was twenty-four years of age, and
to each girl at the age of twenty-one or her marriage,
whichever should first happen. The charge of fitting
out and transporting that number was estimated at
£500, which sum the court agreed should be levied
on the inhabitants of the city rateably according as
each was assessed towards the last poor rate. The
young emigrants were soon afterwards shipped to their
new home,<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a> and so successfully did the undertaking
turn out that in little over a year another application
was made to the Common Council (18 Dec., 1619)
for another batch of 100 children for shipment to
the colony in the following spring.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a> It was desired
that the new emigrants should be twelve years old
and upwards, with an allowance of £3 apiece for
their transportation and 40<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> apiece for their apparel,
"as was formerly graunted." The boys would be
put out as apprentices until the age of twenty-one,
and the girls likewise until the same age or marriage,
after which they would be placed as tenants on the
public lands, and be furnished with houses, stock of
corn and cattle to begin with, and afterwards enjoy
the moiety of all increase and profit. The Common
Council being desirous of forwarding "soe worthy
and pious a worke" as the plantation, accepted<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the company's proposal, and directed that a sum
of £500 necessary for the purpose should be levied
as on the previous occasion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some hitch, however, appears to have occurred in
connection with the shipment of this second consignment
of children. The City and the Virginia Company
had fallen out for some reason or other. In a letter
written about this time to the lord mayor<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> the
company express regret that differences should have
arisen between the city and themselves. They assure
his lordship that there was no real foundation for
these differences, seeing that they had now ratified
all, and more than all than had been previously
offered and accepted. Everything had been done
that was necessary for the shipment of the children.
The City had collected the requisite funds and the
children had been provided, whilst the company on
its part had provided a fair ship, and the Privy
Council had "at the city's desire" granted its warrant.<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a>
The company therefore trusted that the lord
mayor and aldermen would proceed to the speedy
ending of differences.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The number of emigrants to Virginia was swelled
by the transportation of a number of idle fellows who
made it their business to follow the king and his
court wherever they might happen to be. Early in
1619, when the king was at Newmarket, he took
occasion to write to Sir Thomas Smith complaining
of the annoyance and desired that they might be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sent to Virginia at the next opportunity.<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> Immediately
on the receipt of this letter Sir Thomas
Smith wrote to Sir Sebastian Hervey, the mayor,
forwarding at the same time the king's letter, and
asking that the batch of idle court loafers which
had already been despatched from Newmarket to
London, as well as those to follow, might be lodged

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Virginia colony—the first of the free colonies
of England—soon became firmly established, and the
City of London can claim to have had no small share
in the work of its establishment. To the enterprising
spirit shown by the citizens in their efforts to forward
the interests of the colony no better testimony is
wanted than a thanksgiving sermon<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> preached (18 April,
1622) in the church of St. Mary-le-Bow by Patrick
Copland, chaplain to the Virginia Company, in commemoration
of the safe arrival of a fleet of nine ships
at the close of the previous year. The City of
London, the preacher said, had on two occasions sent
over 100 persons to Virginia, and the present lord
mayor and his brethren the aldermen intended to
pursue the same course as previous mayors. "Your
cittie," he continued, "aboundeth in people (and long
may it doe so); the plantation in Virginia is capable
enough to receive them. O, take course to ease
your cittie, and to provide well for your people, by<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

colony there and they of your owne cittie here may
live to bless your prudent and provident government
over them.... Right Worshipfull, I beseech you
ponder (as I know you doe) the forlorne estate of
many of the best members of your citty, and helpe
them, O helpe them out of their misery; what you
bestow uppon them in their transportation to Virginia
they will repay it at present with their prayers, and
when they are able with their purses."<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few months after this sermon had been delivered
tidings reached England of a calamity more disastrous
than any that had yet befallen the colony. A
treacherous attack had been made upon the white men
by the Indians, which was only just saved by timely
notice from becoming a general massacre. As it was,
nearly 350 of the settlers were killed. The Common
Council lost no time in testifying its sympathy with
the colony in the great loss it had sustained, and
voted (19 July) a third sum of £500 towards the
transportation of 100 fresh colonists.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ever since his accession to the throne of England
the financial condition of James had been going from
bad to worse. Besides resorting to antiquated feudal
exactions,<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a> he took to levying impositions on articles

deficiency created in his exchequer by his wanton<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
extravagance, and in 1610 he was obliged to apply to
parliament. An attempt to make a composition with
the king for feudal dues and to restrict his claim to
levy impositions failed, and parliament was hastily
dissolved.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile James had applied to the City
(April, 1610) for a loan of £100,000. He professed
to prefer borrowing the money from the citizens to
raising it by privy seals from his subjects generally,
and he promised interest at the rate of ten per cent.
and security on the customs. The aldermen consented
to raise the money "out of aboundance of love ...
but not of aboundance of riches or meanes." They
and the Recorder divided themselves into nine several
companies or divisions, each bound to furnish one-ninth
of the whole loan. The king gave his own bond in
£150,000 besides bonds of the farmer of the customs
as security, and the aldermen set to work to raise the
money in as "secret and discreet manner" as they
could.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> The loan did not go far towards discharging
the king's liabilities, or those of the late queen, whose
debts James had undertaken to repay. Before the
end of the year (1610) certain wealthy merchants of
the city were summoned to Whitehall to discuss the
state of affairs. The king again wanted money, but
inasmuch as he confessed himself unable to do more
than pay the interest on former loans, leaving the
principal to be discharged at some future time, they
refused to make any further advances, consenting
only not to press for the repayment of outstanding<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
debts.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> Pursuant to this agreement the citizens, in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king had a right to look for consideration
from the city, for in 1608 he had not only confirmed
the liberties and franchises of the citizens by charter,
but he had extended the civic jurisdiction, and had
created all aldermen who had "passed the chair"
Justices of Oyer and Terminer within the city and
its liberties. He had, moreover, allowed them to
tax non-freemen and strangers and to cause them to
contribute in like manner as themselves to all talliages,
aids and grants to the king.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> Two years later—soon

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The marriage of his daughter, the Princess
Elizabeth, with Frederick, the Elector Palatine, which
was soon to follow, not only involved James in further
pecuniary difficulties, but eventually plunged him into
a continental war. Although the marriage articles
were signed in May, 1612, the Elector did not arrive
in England until October, just at the time when Sir
John Swinnerton was about to enter on his duties as
mayor for the ensuing year. Special precautions
were taken to keep order and guard against accident
on lord mayor's day<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> as soon as it was known that
the Elector would attend, and a pageant, entitled

number of nobles invited was so great that there was
scarcely room for the customary representatives from

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The close of the year witnessed a marriage of a
very different character, viz., the union of the king's
favourite, Carr, Earl of Somerset, with Frances
Howard, the divorced wife of the Earl of Essex.
Murderess and adulteress as she was, she was
received at court with every honour; but when the
king proposed to sup one night in the city, and to
bring his whole court with him (including, of course,
the newly-married couple), the lord mayor, Sir
Thomas Middleton, demurred, excusing himself on
the ground that his house was too small.<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a> This
excuse was of no avail, and the supper took place
in Merchant Taylors' Hall, the earl and countess
being specially invited as well as the entire court. The
supper was followed by a masque devised for the
occasion by a namesake of the mayor, Thomas
Middleton, the dramatic poet.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> The entertainment

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Financial difficulties, which a fresh issue of
"privy seals" to the aldermen for loans of £200<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

had been aggravated by recent court festivities, at
length drove James to run the risk of summoning
another parliament. He had learnt from the wire-pullers
of the day—or "undertakers" as they were
then called—that he could depend upon a majority
being returned which would be willing to grant supplies
in return for certain concessions.  In this he
was deceived. No sooner did constituents discover
that pressure was being brought to bear in favour
of court candidates than they used their best efforts
to frustrate such a manifest design to pack parliament.
The session was opened on the 5th of April
by a speech from the king, in which he set forth
his financial difficulties, which the extraordinary
charge in connection with his daughter's marriage
had helped to increase. He would not bargain for
their money, he said, but would leave it entirely
to their love what supplies should be granted. In
token of his own affection towards his subjects
he was ready to make certain concessions, and
he entirely disavowed any complicity with the
"strange kind of beasts called undertakers." The
new parliament, however, stood out like the last
and refused to grant supplies until public grievances
had been considered. The result was that on the
7th June James dissolved what he had fondly
hoped would have proved to be a "parliament of
love," but which from its inability to pass a single<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
measure came to be nick-named, "the addled parliament."<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At his wit's end for money, James had recourse
to benevolences. The bishops offered him the value
of the best piece of plate in their possession to
help him out of his difficulties, and their example
induced many of the nobles to open their purses.
Application was again made to the City for a loan of
£100,000.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> This they declined, but made the king a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was now that the City began to resort to the
practice of recruiting their Chamber by nominating
and electing as sheriffs those who were likely to
prefer paying a fine to serving—a practice which more
especially prevailed during the troublous times of the
Stuarts. Nearly a dozen individuals were elected one
after another to the office at Midsummer of this year,
and one and all declined. Some, like Sir Arthur
Ingram, had sufficient influence at court to obtain
their discharge without fine, others paid fines varying
in amount, which served to fill the City's exchequer.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another reason, however, is given for so many

was that men declined to serve sheriff with Peter

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shrewd ex-barber soon overcame any feeling

orders were given for a general muster and survey of

from such orders, except when the necessities of the
times demanded that it should be otherwise. In 1614
the lords of the council thought fit to include the city
in their order for a general muster, and they wrote
(16 Sept.) to the mayor requiring him to cause "a
generall view" to be taken of the city's forces, and an
enrolment made "of such trayned members as in her
late majesty's time were put into companies by the
name of the trayned bands." Vacancies among the
officers and soldiers were to be filled up, armour and

their swords are described as only "Irish hilts and

ordered another fifteenth to be levied on the

following year the trained bands were divided into
four regiments, under the command of Sir Thomas
Lowe, Sir Thomas Middleton, Sir John Watts, and
Sir John Swinnerton, and quartered in different parts
of the city for the purpose of putting down riots.
For these measures the mayor, Sir John Jolles, and
the aldermen received the thanks of the lords of the

not having made a return of men and arms with
which the city was provided, as previously directed.
Their lordships had been informed that the city
was altogether unprovided with arms and could not
furnish the full number of trained men with weapons
at one and the same time, and that there was scarce
sufficient match and powder in the whole city to
serve for one day's training. They expressed astonishment
that the civic authorities, in whom was vested
the government of the king's Chamber, should have
proved so negligent in a matter so important, and
directed them to set up forthwith a magazine of arms
for supplying not only the inhabitants of the city,
but also those of adjacent counties, with military
weapons, and to supply themselves with a store
of gunpowder of not less than 100 lasts, by the aid<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the city companies, as had been usual in like cases.
A certificate was also to be returned without delay
to their lordships according to previous orders. The
matter was referred by the Common Council to the
"committees for martial causes" in the city, with
instructions to report thereon to the Court of
Aldermen.</p>

when the lords of the council gave notice (17 May,

and at the same time directed the Court of Aldermen
to furnish them with a certificate of the number
of men enrolled in the trained bands (such as had

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That James, like his predecessor on the throne, had
the increase of the material prosperity of his subjects
very much at heart there is little doubt. The measures,
however, which he took for increasing that prosperity
were not always sound. Among these must be reckoned
the withdrawal of all licences for the exportation of
undyed and undressed cloth,<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> the suppression of the old
company of Merchant Adventurers and the formation
of a new company. For these measures the king was
not so much to blame as William Cockaine, the city
alderman who gave him advice on the matter. That
the advice was bad became soon manifest. The Dutch,
who had been the principal buyers of English undyed
cloth, retaliated by setting up looms for themselves,
and threatened to destroy the English cloth trade
altogether. The new company, with Cockaine at its
head, proved a complete failure, and the old company
was restored.<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a></p>

Cockaine had enjoyed the honour of entertaining the

the entertainment, which took place on the 8th June,
1616—including a bason of gold and £1,000 presented
to James and another gift of £500 to Prince Charles—amounted
to more than £3,000, and this (we are
told) was discharged by the company, whilst his
majesty reserved his thanks for Cockaine alone, and
at parting conferred upon him the honour of knighthood
with the civic sword.<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few months later (Nov., 1616) the city was
the scene of another festive gathering, the occasion
being a supper given at Drapers' Hall to the recently
created Knights of the Bath. That the wives of city
burgesses were looked upon as fair game for the
courtier to fly at may be seen in the works of the
dramatists of the day; nor was the merchant's or
tradesman's daughter averse to the attention of the
court gallant when kept within reasonable bounds, but
on this occasion the exuberant spirits of the knights,
after the long ordeal they had recently gone through,
appear to have overcome them, for, we are told, they
were so rude and unmannerly and carried themselves<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so insolently divers ways, but specially in "putting

whereupon they left the hall in high dudgeon
without waiting for the supper prepared for them.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Previous to his departure on a progress to Scotland
in the spring of 1617, the king addressed a letter to the
mayor and Common Council of the City asking for a
loan of £100,000.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> The necessary occasions of his affairs,
he said, required just then "the present use of good
somes of money," by way of a loan, and he could
think of no better way of supplying himself than by
resorting, as his forefathers had done, "to the love"
of his city, and borrowing the money upon the credit
of its common bonds. He reminded them that
whenever he had borrowed money the lenders had
always received "royall paiement," and he doubted
not that they would now act as their own registers
and records would show that their predecessors had
acted on similar occasions. On the 22nd January this
application was read to the Common Council, when,
after mature deliberation, it was unanimously agreed—"without
either word or hand to the contrary"—that
one or more bonds should be made in the name of the
Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of London,
under their common seal, for the repayment of
principal, together with interest, to those who were
willing to contribute towards the loan, upon such
counter security as was mentioned in the king's
letter. The security there mentioned was to be under
the great seal and of such a character as the city had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been accustomed formerly to receive from the king's
predecessors. It appears that James had a few days
before endeavoured to get the citizens to advance the
sum of £100,000 on the security of the crown jewels,
but this proposal had met with little favour.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March the mayor, John Leman, received the
honour of knighthood and was publicly thanked by the
king for the forwardness displayed by the citizens
in the loan, although the money had not at the time
been raised.<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> Great difficulty was experienced in
raising the money. One London merchant, John
Eldred, whose name frequently occurs in the State
Papers in connection with advances to the king,
endeavoured to get the amount of his assessment
reduced by £400,<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> whilst another, William Cater,

which called forth a reprimand from the lords of the
council. The city authorities had been observed to
omit or else to sparingly handle many of the best
citizens who were "nicetest" to be dealt with, and
especially intended for the purpose, and to lay the
burden of contribution upon persons of weak and mean
estate, or such as otherwise by their quality and place
were not so fit to be called upon for any such occasion.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James had recently been worrying the mayor
into consenting to a match between his daughter, a
girl barely fourteen years of age, and Christopher
Villiers, son of the Countess of Buckingham. The
match was "so much against the old man's stomach,"
wrote a contemporary,<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> "as the conceit thereof hath
brought him very near his grave already." He had
publicly declared that he would rather that he and his
daughter were both dead than that he should give his
consent. The king pressed matters so far as one day
to send for the mayor, his wife and daughter, from
dinner at Merchant Taylors' Hall, in order to urge
upon them the marriage.<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> It was perhaps owing to
the strained relations existing at the time between
the king and the mayor that the civic authorities
were not invited to the funeral of the queen. If
that be the case James soon saw that he had made a
mistake, and in order "to please them" caused a
memorial service to be held on Trinity Sunday at
Paul's Cross, which was attended by the aldermen
and other officers of the city, but not by Hervey,
the mayor, who—"wilful and dogged" as he may
have been—had become seriously ill from the king's
importunity and was unable to be present.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a></p>

London and the kingdom. In 1618 the Protestant
nobility of Bohemia deposed their king, the Emperor
Matthias, and in the following year they deposed his
successor, Ferdinand, after unceremoniously flinging
his deputies out of the window, and offered the crown
to Frederick, the Elector Palatine, who had married
James's daughter, the Princess Elizabeth. The
Elector asked his father-in-law's advice before accepting
the proffered crown, but James shilly-shallied
so long that Frederick could wait no longer,
and he signified his acceptance (26 Aug., 1619).
James was urged to lend assistance to his son-in-law
against the deposed Ferdinand, who had become by
election the Emperor Ferdinand II, but to every
appeal he turned a deaf ear.</p>

assessment made in the mayoralty of Sir Thomas
Middleton (1613-14). Several of the companies, and
notably the Merchant Taylors (the largest contributors),
objected to this mode of imposing assessment

injustice. The Court of Aldermen therefore agreed

would the companies have been called upon on this

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When parliament at length met (after several
prorogations) on the 30th January (1621) James
opened the session with a long speech, in which a
request for supplies held a prominent place. The
Commons, however, without showing any disposition
to be captious, were in no hurry to grant war supplies
until they were assured that there was to be a war.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The king had therefore to be content with a grant of
no more than two subsidies, or about £160,000. He
had recently issued a proclamation (24 Dec., 1620)
forbidding his subjects to speak on affairs of State.<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a>
If the nation in general was to be thus bridled the
Commons showed their determination, whilst criticising
the king's administration, to vindicate at least their
own right to liberty of speech.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was also a class of Londoner not easily
silenced. A royal proclamation had no terrors for the
London apprentice; and when they recognised an
old enemy in the person of the Spanish ambassador<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a>
in the street, they were accustomed to give tongue
and, if thwarted, to resort to blows. It happened one
day that as Gondomar was being carried down
Fenchurch Street, an apprentice standing idly with
one or two of his fellows at his master's door cried
out, "There goeth the devil in a dung-cart." This
remark raised a laugh which so stung one of the
ambassador's servants that he turned sharply on the
offender. "Sir," said he, "you shall see Bridewell
ere long for your mirth." "What," cried one of his
fellows, "shall we go to Bridewell for such a dog as
thou?" and forthwith brought him to the ground
with a box on the ear. The ambassador laid a
complaint before the mayor, who somewhat reluctantly
sentenced the offending apprentices to be whipt<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at the cart's tail. That any of their number should be
flogged for insulting a Spaniard, even though he were
the Spanish king's ambassador, was intolerable to the
minds of the apprentices of London, who were known
for their staunchness to one another. The report
spread like wildfire, and soon a body of nearly 300
apprentices had assembled at Temple Bar, where they
rescued their comrades and beat the city marshals.
Again Gondomar complained to the mayor, who, sympathising
at heart with the delinquents, testily replied
that it was not to the Spanish ambassador that he
had to give an account of the government of the
city. The matter having reached the king's ears at
Theobalds, he suddenly appeared at the Guildhall
and threatened to place a garrison in the city and
to deprive the citizens of their charter if matters
were not mended. His anger was with difficulty
appeased by the Recorder, and he at last contented
himself with privately admonishing the aldermen to
see the young fellows punished. The end of the
affair was tragical enough. The original sentence
was carried out, with the result that one of the
apprentices unhappily died.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the account of the disturbance as found
in contemporary letters. From the City's records<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a> we
learn a few additional particulars. On Wednesday,
the 4th April, a special Court of Aldermen sat, at
which a letter from the lords of the council was read
signifying the king's pleasure that David Sampson,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an apprentice to a tailor, should be very sharply
whipt through the city from Aldgate to Fleet Street
by the common executioner for an insult offered
the Spanish ambassador on the preceding Monday
(2 April). A good guard was also to be appointed
for the purpose, and instructions were given to the
Recorder and some of the aldermen to discover if
possible the rest of the offenders. The result of their
efforts in this direction was the apprehension of
Robert Michell, an apprentice to a haberdasher, and
Richard Taylor, an apprentice to a bricklayer, the
former of whom was accused of threatening to throw
a loaf at the "choppes" of the ambassador's servant,
and the latter with having actually discharged a
brickbat with effect at one of his suite. Sampson's
whipping, which ought to have taken place in the
forenoon of Wednesday, was thereupon postponed
until the afternoon, when all three offenders were
punished together, in the presence of a good guard.
On the following morning (5 April) another special
Court of Aldermen sat at the mayor's own house,
when it was ordered that Daniel Ray, a drayman,
who had been convicted of holding up his hand
at the Spanish ambassador as he passed through
Gracechurch Street, grinning at him and calling him
"Spanish dogge" just before Michell and Taylor
committed their excesses, should also be whipt
between eight and nine o'clock the next morning.
In order to prevent a repetition of the disturbance
which had occurred the previous day, the mayor
issued his precept<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a>(5 April) for a substantial double
watch to be kept for twenty-four hours from nine<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
o'clock in the evening of the 5th April. The inhabitants
were further ordered to stand at their doors,
halberd in hand, and ready for any emergency, whilst
they were to see that their apprentices, children and
servants behaved well towards all ambassadors and
strangers as well as his majesty's subjects.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time news of the confusion and rescue
attending the earlier punishment had reached the
king's ears. Ray's whipping was put off. The
Recorder informed the Court of Aldermen, specially
summoned to the mayor's house on Friday afternoon
(6 April), that the king purposed coming that
day to the Guildhall in person between two and three
o'clock, when the mayor and aldermen were commanded
to attend, and until then the execution of
Ray's punishment was not to be carried out. At the
appointed hour James arrived with divers lords of the
council. He is recorded<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a> as having made an excellent
oration to the mayor and aldermen, "much reprovinge
their misgovernment, and the ill carriage of the rude
sorte of people, and the affront lately offered to justice
in that rescue." He commanded them at their
peril to see that no manner of affront occurred in the
punishment of Daniel Ray, but that he should after
his whipping be quietly conveyed to prison until his
majesty's pleasure should be further known. Three
days later (9 April) Ray, Sampson and Taylor
(Michell appears to have been the one who succumbed
to ill treatment) appeared before a special
Court of Aldermen and, acknowledging their offences,
asked pardon of God and the king. Thereupon the
Recorder signified to them the king's remission of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
further punishment, and they were discharged out
of prison.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the Commons were chafing under the
restriction which forbade them mentioning even the
name of the Palatinate, an elderly individual named
Floyd was imprisoned in the Fleet for displaying joy
at the news of the battle of Prague. "Goodman
Palsgrave and Goodwife Palsgrave," he had been
heard to say, "were now turned out of doors." All
sorts of punishment was suggested by members of
the House, which after all had no jurisdiction in the
matter whatever; and after a kind of three-cornered
duel between the king, the Lords and Commons,
Floyd was made to expiate his crime by riding from
Fleet Bridge to the Standard in Cheapside, his face
towards the horse's tail, and having a paper in his
hat with the words, "For using ignominious and
malicious words against the Prince and Princess
Palatine, the king's only daughter and children."
After standing there for two hours he was branded
on his forehead with the letter K and conveyed to
the Fleet.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Commons having voted supplies, albeit small
and inadequate for the king's wants, James lost no
time in asking the citizens for an advance on the
amount of subsidy due from them. On the 27th
March (1621) the lord treasurer wrote very urgently
on the matter. "I pray you," he added by way of
postscript, "make noe stickinge hereatt; you shall
bee sure to bee paid att the tyme named."<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> If the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

notice, they were asked to give credit for the rest
to the merchant whom Baron Dohna should appoint
for transferring the money to the Palatinate by
bills of exchange. It was all to no purpose. The
mayor and aldermen were tired of the repeated
calls upon their purse, and returned answer by word
of mouth of the Common Sergeant and the Remembrancer
that the City hoped rather to receive
part of the money already lent than to "runne in
further."<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The failure of negotiations for a Spanish match,
and the return of Prince Charles after his romantic
expedition in 1623 without bringing the Infanta with
him, was a source of great satisfaction both to the
City and the nation. The following story of the day
serves to illustrate the feeling prevalent at the time
relative to the Spanish match. The bishop of London
had given orders to the clergy, pursuant to instructions
he had himself received from James, not to "prejudicate
the prince's journey by their prayers," but
only to pray to God to bring him safely home again
and no more. A clergyman, who must have been a
bit of a wag (for it is difficult to explain his conduct
otherwise), is said to have literally carried out his
bishop's orders, and to have prayed publicly "That
God would return our noble prince home again to us
and no more."<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> When it became known that the
prince had arrived safely at Madrid, bonfires were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lighted and bells rung; but the Londoners were but
half-hearted in expressing their joy, and would probably
have made no display had they not received
orders from the lords of the council.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> It was otherwise
when the prince returned—and without the
Infanta. As soon as news reached the mayor that
Charles had arrived at Guildford he issued his precept
(6 Oct.) for bells to be rung and bonfires to
be lighted,<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> and right gladly were his orders carried
out. "I have not heard of more demonstrations of
public joy than were here and everywhere, from

London;<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> "such spreading of tables in the streets

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's foreign policy having proved a total
failure, there was no other course open for him but to
summon a parliament. A parliament was accordingly
summoned to meet in February of the next year
(1624). The king and Commons soon found themselves
in opposition, the former advocating a war in
Germany for the defence of the Palatinate, the latter
a war against Spain. At length a compromise was
effected, the Commons agreeing to vote supplies on
the understanding that James broke off all negotiations
with Spain.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Negotiations with Spain were thereupon broken
off, but not before James had found another ally in
France. Before parliament was prorogued (29 May)
James had sounded Louis XIII as to a marriage
between Charles and Henrietta Maria, the French
king's sister. In April Count Mansfeld, a German
adventurer who had offered his services to France,
arrived in England and was hospitably entertained.
The object of his visit was to see the extent of the
preparations that were being made for war.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strenuous efforts to raise money in the city were
made. Chamberlain, writing to Carleton from London
(1 July), tells his friend, "Here is great expedition
used to raise money, and make ready payment;
insomuch that since Monday sevennight, the council
have sat thrice at Guildhall about the subsidies."
The lord keeper, in his endeavours to persuade the
citizens to loosen their purse-strings, went so far as to
declare that anyone disguising his wealth was
committing the sin against the Holy Ghost, and was
as Ananias and Saphira! So great was the general
decay, both in the city and the country, that there
was some talk of putting in force the penal laws
against recusants, notwithstanding the negotiations
that were going on for a French marriage, in order to
make up the expected deficit.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> The civic authorities
were again pressing the king for the repayment
of the loan (£100,000) made in 1617. Time had
wrought alterations in the condition of the lenders;
some were dead and their widows and orphans
were crying out for repayment; some were decayed
and imprisoned, and others likely to undergo the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same calamity if steps were not taken for their
speedy relief. They complained that the city's seal,
which had by his majesty's command been given as
security to the tenders, suffered as never it had done
before, and several suits had been commenced against
the Chamber of London in the courts at Westminster,
to which they knew not how to give satisfactory
answer. They therefore prayed him to give order
for such payment to be made to them as might give
relief to the distressed and comfort to them all. The
result was that the king directed (July, 1624) his
two principal secretaries and the chancellor of the
exchequer to devise means for satisfying the debt.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In September Mansfield was again in England
asking for men and money for the recovery of the
Palatinate, in which he had been assured of the
co-operation of France. This assurance, however,
was only a verbal one, and nothing would induce
Louis to reduce it to writing. James on his part was
willing to make every concession, provided that the
matrimonial alliance on which he had set his heart
could be brought to a happy conclusion. But as these
concessions involved broken pledges, he feared to face
the Commons, and thus the parliament, which should
have re-assembled this autumn, was further prorogued
and never met again until James was no more.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was to James's last parliament that the City
was indebted for a statute,<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> which at length insured

pretext that it had concealed lands charged with
superstitious uses which had not been redeemed. In
1618 a commission had been appointed to enquire as
to the waste grounds of the city, on pretence of
concealment; but upon representation being made by
the mayor and aldermen that the City had long
enjoyed the lands in question by ancient grant, proceedings
had been stayed.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> Early in the following year

king for a grant of letters patent, securing both for
the City and the companies quiet enjoyment of their
possessions, lest in that "searching age" other defects
might haply be found in their title, to be followed
by further inconveniences. To this the king readily
assented, and instructed the attorney-general to draw
up letters patent embracing such matters as the City
desired.<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> The letters patent were no sooner drawn

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question how to supply Mansfield with men
as well as money necessary for his undertaking in the
absence of parliament was answered by making
application to the Council of War. On the 29th
October orders were issued for pressing 12,000 men
for the service, and on the same day James himself
wrote to the mayor for 2,000 men to be pressed in
the city to assist in the recovery of the Palatinate.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>
Two days afterwards (31 Oct.) followed a letter from
the lords of the council<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> directing the mayor to see
that the men were of able bodies and years, but
not taken out of the trained bands, which were to
be left entire. They were to be ready by the end of
November to march to Dover under such officers as
the Privy Council might select. As the amount of
conduct money, which was usually a half-penny per
mile, would vary owing to the difference of localities
where the men lived, it was thought best to allow
them their ordinary pay of eightpence per day from<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the time they were handed over to the officers. The
mayor was further directed to demand of the collectors
of the subsidy sufficient money for the charge of coats,
conduct, armour, etc. On the last day of November
the lords of the council wrote again informing the
lord mayor of the names of the officers appointed to
conduct the men to Dover by the 24th December.
He was to see that the men were delivered to the
officers by roll indented, to be subscribed by himself
or his deputy-lieutenants on the one part and the
captains or officers on the other part.<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> The service
was very unpopular; many deserted, and it was with
difficulty that the rest could be got to the sea-coast.
The city contingent was ordered to assemble at Leadenhall
on the night of the 18th December or by the next
morning at the latest, in order to set out on their march
by Monday, the 20th. The full complement of men
was to be made up and the bail of deserters estreated.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was little to hope for from raw levies such
as these were, transported into a hostile country
under the leadership of a foreigner. "God speed

experience or reading to have such a body of
English committed and commanded by a stranger,
to say no more." On their way to Dover the men
carried out a system of pillage as if already in an
enemy's country; and as soon as they found their
pay was not forthcoming they mutinied.<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> The<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
promises of the French king proved fallacious and
Mansfeld was forbidden to land his forces in France.
This prohibition, however, was little to him, for he
had already determined to act in direct opposition to
the wishes of James and to carry his army to
Flushing. Before he set sail from Dover, which he
did on the 31st January (1625), it became necessary
to recruit his rapidly diminishing forces by the issue
of new press warrants. The City was called upon to
furnish 1,000 men in addition to those already
supplied.<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> The mayor's precept on this occasion
directed the alderman of each ward to seize in their
beds or otherwise all able-bodied men, and especially
"all tapsters, ostlers, chamberlains, vagrants, idle and
suspected persons," and to convey them to Leadenhall
or Bridewell. Those who had previously been pressed
and had absconded were to be particularly sought
for, whilst those who had in their charge two small
children were to be spared.<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> At Flushing, where
Mansfeld landed his forces (1 Feb.), the men were
soon decimated by want of food, the inclemency of
the season, and sickness, so that, at the time of
James's death (27 March), out of a force of 12,000
men there were barely left 3,000 capable of carrying
arms.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The commencement of the reign of Charles I,
like his father's, was marked by a recurrence of the
plague, which greatly affected the trade of the city.
Matters were made worse by an application from the
Lord High Treasurer for a loan of £60,000 to the
king within a few weeks of Charles ascending the
throne. He promised that the money, which was
wanted for fitting out the fleet which the late king
was busy preparing at the time of his death, should
be repaid in six months. Interest would be allowed
at the rate of eight per cent., and Charles would
give mortgage security for repayment of this as well
as of the sum of £100,000 borrowed by James.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>
After mature deliberation the Common Council agreed
(16 April) to accede to the Lord Treasurer's request,
and appointed two representatives of each ward to
consult with the mayor and aldermen as to the mode
of raising the amount, as well as to consider the
nature of the security offered. On the 20th May
the Common Council received the committee's report
on the matter.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> It recommended that the money
should be borrowed and taken up by twenty aldermen
and one hundred commoners nominated for the
purpose; that five commoners should be allotted to
each alderman, and that they should stand bound for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sum of £3,000. Any alderman or commoner
refusing to be so joined was to be forced to lend
£1,000 on his own account. The assurance of the
king's lands was to be made in the names of such
aldermen and commoners as the Court of Aldermen
should appoint. A week later (27 May) the Court of
Aldermen, in anticipation of the money being raised,
ordered an advance to be made to the king out of the
City's Chamber of the sum of £14,000.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> On the 2nd

being no longer any necessity for keeping the bonds

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 1st May Charles was married by proxy at

a while the danger likely to arise from the heir to the
throne allying himself in marriage with a Catholic
princess. On her arrival in the Thames in June
the citizens gave her a hearty welcome, whilst

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime (1 May) Charles had issued his
warrant to the lord mayor for levying 1,000 men—"part

Houses of Parliament, in contemplation of the distress

thought that if he could only gain a victory it would
serve to draw a veil over his delinquencies. The City
was to be assisted by the county of Middlesex in raising
the men,<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> and an allowance was made for "coat
and conduct money" for the soldiers at the rate
of eightpence apiece per day for their journey to
Plymouth, the place where they were to embark
(£400), and four shillings a coat (£200), the pay of
a captain being four shillings a day.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a> The mayor's
precept to the aldermen to raise the men enjoined
them to search all inns, taverns, alehouses, "tabling-houses"
and tobacco-houses, and to press, especially,
all "tapsters, ostlers, chamberlains, vagrants, idle and
suspected persons."<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> By August the condition of
the troops at Plymouth was pitiable. No money was
forthcoming for wages, and the soldiers were forced to
forage for themselves in the neighbouring country.
At last the fleet set sail (8 Oct., 1625). Its destination
proved to be Cadiz, whither it was despatched
in the hope of securing West Indian treasure on its
way home. The expedition, however, turned out to
be as complete a failure as that under Mansfeld in the
previous year.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizen soldiers returned to find their city
almost deserted owing to the ravages of the plague.
In July the sickness had been so great as to necessitate
the adjournment of parliament to Oxford.<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a> The colder
weather, as winter approached, appears to have made
but little difference. Dr. Donne, the Dean of St.
Paul's, estimated that in November there died a
thousand a day in the city of London and within the
circuit of a mile. "The citizens fled away as out of a
house on fire," he writes,<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> they "stuffed their pockets
with their best ware and threw themselves into the
highways, and were not received so much as into
barns, and perished so, some of them with more
money about them than would have bought the
village where they died." Donne himself removed
to Chelsea, but the infection even there became so
great that "it was no good manners to go to any
other place," and Donne therefore did not go to court.
As early as September the want and misery in the
city was described as being the greatest that ever any
man living knew: "No trading at all, the rich all
gone, house-keepers and apprentices of manual
trades begging in the streets, and that in such a
lamentable manner as will make the strongest heart
to yearn."<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a></p>

of Aldermen to devise measures for relieving the City
from the burden of supplying military arms and
"other like services" such as they had recently been
called upon to perform.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a> The committee had not
been long appointed before the City was called upon
to look to its stock of gunpowder, prepare the trained
bands,<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> and furnish the king with five ships towards
protecting the river. This last demand was made on
the ground that they had furnished vessels for the
same purpose in the reign of Elizabeth.<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> The Court
of Aldermen objected. Times were changed since
Elizabeth's day, the lords of the council were informed
in reply; the galleys then furnished by the City were
only wanted for a short time and when the country
was threatened with an invasion; but even then considerable
difficulty was experienced before the Common
Council passed an Act for supplying the vessels.
At the present time, when the City was in a far worse
condition than then, there was little or no hope of a
similar Act being passed.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a></p>

was not a whit more inclined to subject its
ancient privileges to the control of the Crown than
its predecessor had been. Buckingham himself, the
king's bosom friend and most trusted adviser, was
impeached; and the Commons declined to vote supplies
until they had presented their grievances to the
king and received his majesty's answer. This was
more than Charles could stand. He summoned them
to Whitehall and commanded them to cancel the
condition. He would give them "liberty of counsel,
not of control." To the urgent entreaty of the Peers
that he would grant a short respite he replied, "Not

money should be found with or without parliament.
Application was made to the City by the lords of the

of £100,000, and a deputation was ordered to wait
upon the king at Greenwich on Sunday, the 25th June,
with the City's answer.<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> The answer given was to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the effect that the City was unable to advance the
sum required, and it occasioned no little disappointment
to the king, who referred the matter back to
the mayor and aldermen once more. It was not that
Charles had not offered sufficient security for the loan.
The money could not be raised. At length it was
agreed (30 June) at another special court that the
aldermen themselves should advance the sum of
£20,000 for one year on the security of the petty
customs.<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> In such haste was this trifling sum required,

To the second the mayor was instructed to reply to
the following effect, viz.—that (1) the City was ready
to share with the rest of his majesty's subjects in a
matter which touched the state and defence of the
whole kingdom; (2) that inasmuch as the City had
been called upon in 1588, when the enemy was upon
the coast, to furnish only ten ships, and that each of
the twenty ships now demanded would, from its
larger burden, cost treble the amount of the former
ships, the citizens humbly desired to be relieved of so
great a charge, in respect of the city's decay in trade
and commerce, and its impoverishment by the late
visitation and otherwise; (3) that the ships could not
be furnished and victualled in the time named; (4) that
the city merchants would be the more willing to
adventure their lives and means against the enemy if
they were allowed letters of mark.<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lords expressed the greatest dissatisfaction
at this answer, and insisted upon the ships being
forthcoming. It was in vain that the City offered
to provide ten ships and two pinnaces; nothing less
than the full number of vessels would suffice, and the
City had eventually to give way.<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Duke of Buckingham, the king's favourite,
whose extravagant projects had ended in nothing but
disaster, had rendered himself most unpopular, and
one day in August his coach was stopped by a band
of sailors, men who had served in the ill-fated
expedition to Cadiz or in the ships which Buckingham
had sent to assist the French king in suppressing the
Huguenots of Rochelle—who clamoured for arrears of
pay. The duke put them off with fair words, and so
escaped with a whole skin; but for long afterwards
the streets of the city, and even the confines of the
royal palace, were infested with disaffected seamen,
and special precautions had to be taken to prevent
riot.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having failed to raise the necessary supplies by a
free gift or benevolence of the nation, Charles betook
himself to a forced loan. The sum to be raised was
fixed at five subsidies. Commissioners were appointed
in September, 1626, to summon before them all men
rated in the subsidy books. At first the scheme
was confined to the five counties nearest London.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Opposition was met by imprisonment. The City for
awhile was left untouched. It was unwise to try the
temper of the citizens too much. It was found that
the nearer the City the greater was the opposition
shown to the commissioners; and the inhabitants of
the Strand and the Savoy offered a more determined
resistance than those of the parish of St. Margaret,
Westminster, or St. Martin-in-the-Fields.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> On the

his majesty's "clear intention" in requiring the aid
of his loving subjects by the loan. It was not to be
made a precedent, and a parliament should be called
as soon as convenient and as often as it should be
necessary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just at a time when privy councillors were about
to set out for the more distant counties to collect the
subsidies the judges suddenly pronounced an unanimous
opinion against the legality of the new loan. The
report of their decision quickly spread, and increased
the opposition of the country gentry, many of whom
were content to suffer imprisonment rather than yield
to the demands of the commissioners.</p>

Hollanders in a descent on the Spanish coast. The
court, after due consideration, directed the committee
to wait upon the lords and inform them that the City
was prepared to spend £1,200 on further victualling,
provided the ships were commanded by officers of the
City's choosing, and were sent to sea alone "to be at
their own liberties and directions without joining or
being consorted with any others whatsoever." The
City was, moreover, to be provided with letters of mark,
and to be allowed to enjoy the benefit of all prizes.<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>

of the occurrence, more especially as some of the murderers
had been heard to say that if Lamb's "master"—the
duke himself—had been there they would have
handled him worse and so minced his flesh that every
one should have had a bit of him. He forthwith
summoned the mayor and sheriffs to court and threatened
to take away their charter if the murderers were
not quickly discovered.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a> The lords of the council also
wrote to the mayor (15 June) reprimanding him for
not taking steps to repress the riot and ordering him

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in July the balance of the second instalment
of £60,000 (part of the late loan of £120,000)
was due from the City, but Charles could not wait so
long. An expedition to Rochelle under the Earl of
Denbigh had recently proved a failure. Determined
not to give way, Charles sent orders to the earl to
refit his squadron and remain in England until the
whole available maritime force of the country could
be got ready to accompany him. Money must be
raised at once. Charles himself wrote to the mayor
and aldermen (30 June) stating that a sudden and
important occasion of the relief of Rochelle required
present succours, and directing them to find immediately
the sum of £20,000 out of the moneys due on
the last purchase of the Crown lands. If they had not
such a sum in hand they were to raise it on credit.<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>
This sum exactly represented the balance due from
the City to the king, and precepts had already been
issued to the livery companies for raising the amount.
Another precept was sent out immediately on receipt
of the king's letter, whilst other precepts were directed
to levying the subsidies granted by parliament.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> The<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fate of Rochelle was, in spite of every effort, soon to
be sealed. The Duke of Buckingham fell by the
hand of an assassin (23 Aug.) whilst engaged at Portsmouth
in superintending preparations for its relief, and
two months later (18 Oct.) the fortress was compelled
to capitulate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the question of the king's right
to claim Tonnage and Poundage for life had given
rise to so much opposition that Charles had occasion
more than once to prorogue parliament. Merchants
had refused to pay the dues, and their goods had
been seized. Recourse was thereupon had to the
Sheriffs' Court of the City, where the owners sued
out a replevin as for property illegally distrained.
Popular feeling was so much on the side of the merchants
that when parliament met Charles publicly
renounced all claim to tonnage and poundage as a
right. Nevertheless the contest continued, and the
feeling of both parties was embittered by mutual
provocation and by proceedings taken in the Star
Chamber against merchants for protecting their
property from these exactions. At length matters
reached such a crisis that Charles determined upon an
adjournment; but no sooner was the king's intention
divined than the Commons determined to put their
grievances into writing and to cause them to be read
by the Speaker, whom they forcibly detained in the
chair. Sir John Finch having refused to accede to
their request, resolutions condemning religious innovation,
as well as the levying of tonnage and poundage,
were hastily put and carried by acclamation, whilst
Black Rod was vainly endeavouring to gain admission
to the House with a message from the king. Before<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The years immediately succeeding the dissolution
of Charles's third parliament, during which he was
preparing a system of personal government destined
eventually to work his own destruction, were years
of sorrow and trouble to the citizens of London. A
"pestilent sickness" again visited the city in the
autumn of 1629—brought over from Holland or
Rochelle—and remained until 1631. It was followed
as usual by a great scarcity of provisions. The civic
authorities did what they could to prevent the spread
of infection and to alleviate the distress, but it was to
little purpose. Riots were of frequent occurrence,
necessitating the keeping a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">posse</span></span> of constables quartered

appeared, namely, the birth of an heir to the crown

£1,000.<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> Two years later, when the prince was

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The year following the birth of Prince Charles
the queen was robbed of a great part of her plate and
jewels. As the thieves were likely to dispose of their
booty among the goldsmiths of the city, a precept was
issued to the master and wardens of the Goldsmiths'
Company to try and recover it.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a> The goldsmiths had
long ago begun to leave Goldsmiths' Row in Cheapside,
and to set up shops in different parts of the city, and
in 1623 they had been ordered to resume their old
quarters, which in the meantime had been given up to
poor petty trades.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> It was easier to trace lost
property when all the goldsmiths were congregated

ineffectually carried out that another order was issued<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the lords of the council ten years later directing
all goldsmiths to find shops for themselves either in
Cheapside or Lombard Street within the next six
months, inasmuch as the practice of setting up their
shops in obscure places in different parts of the city
offered facilities for abuses, and more especially "in
passing away of stolen plate."<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Five years had now elapsed since the dissolution

had submitted to the personal government of Charles.
Matters might have continued on the same footing
for some time longer had not Charles conceived the
idea of claiming the sovereignty of the seas as a
pretext for raising a fleet. The difficulty then arose
as to how to equip a fleet without summoning a
parliament. It had been the custom ever since the
time of the Plantagenets to call upon maritime
towns to furnish ships ready manned for the defence
of the realm at a time of threatened invasion. This
custom had been rendered sufficiently elastic to
comprise the port of London, and the City had
frequently been called upon to furnish a contingent of
vessels in time of war. Occasionally a protest may
have been made against such demands, but they
were seldom, if ever, altogether refused. On the
20th October, 1634, writs were issued calling upon
the city of London and various port towns and
places along the coast to furnish a certain number
of ships of war, and to have them ready at Portsmouth
by the 1st March, 1635. In many cases it
was impossible to supply ships of the size required,
and in these the king offered to supply ships of his
own on condition that the port towns should equip
and man them. London was called upon to supply
seven ships varying in size from 300 to 900 tons, with
an equipment of from 150 to 350 men.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In June, 1636, Richard Chambers, a merchant,
who had previously displayed a bold front against the
king's demand of tonnage and poundage, for which
the Star Chamber had condemned him to a term of
imprisonment (1628-1629), again came to the fore,
and carried the question of the king's right to levy
ship money to the Court of King's Bench.  The
judges, however, refused to allow the question to be
argued. "There was a rule of law and a rule of
government"—said Justice Berkeley, scarce realising
the true import of his words—"and many things
which might not be done by the rule of law might be
done by the rule of government." Chambers was
again committed for contempt, but was afterwards
liberated from prison upon payment of the £10 at
which he had been assessed. He contented himself
with bringing an action in the King's Bench against
the mayor, who had made the assessment on the
ground of some technical informality.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other matters had arisen lately—"great and
important businesses"—all tending towards an
estrangement of the City from the king. Early in
1635 the City had been condemned by the Court of
Star Chamber to a fine of £70,000 and the loss of its
Irish estate for having, as was alleged, broken the
terms of the charter under which their Irish estate<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was held. One of the charges against the city and
the companies was that they continued to employ the
"mere Irish" on their estates instead of relegating
them to the narrow limits reserved for them, there to
perish of disease or starvation.<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a> There were differences
too touching the Royal Contract, differences as
to the City's rights to estreated recognisances, as to
pretended encroachments and other matters. It was
felt that there would be no peace until some arrangement
could be made with Charles on all the matters
in question, and for this purpose a committee was
appointed in May, 1636, to see what could be done.
A schedule of "thinges desired by the cittie of
London" was drawn up, and an offer was made to the
king of the sum of £100,000, to be paid by annual
instalments of £20,000, if he would make the concessions
desired.<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a> The king's commissioners, who
had the business in hand, refused the offer. They
informed the committee that not only would the City
have to surrender certain valuable fisheries and other
privileges in Ireland, as well as the castle of Culmore,
but it would have to provide an allowance of £5,000
to Sir Thomas Philips. Instead of £100,000 it would
have moreover to pay £120,000.<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a> Negotiations continued
for two years. Eventually a compromise was
effected in June, 1638, and the city was fain to accept
a pardon on surrendering its Irish estates and payment
of the comparatively small sum of £12,000,<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> of

companies were not however actually surrendered
until 1639.<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime Charles had given umbrage to
the City in other matters, more especially in the
measures he had taken for regulating trade and the
institution of corporate monopolies. An order restricting
the use of coaches and carts, and forbidding
anyone to keep a carriage unless he was also prepared
to keep four sufficient horses or geldings for
the king's service, weighed heavily upon the mayor
and aldermen of the city, who were for the most
part men advanced in years and whose duties carried
them a good deal abroad. They therefore petitioned
the king for an exception to be made in their
favour. The petition was granted, but only after long
delay.<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The civic authorities were not better pleased with
the king for his having (1636), in spite of all protest,
created a new corporation which embraced all tradesmen
and artificers in the city and suburbs, and thus
threatened to be a formidable rival to the ancient
corporation.<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of a growing feeling of dissatisfaction
at the existing state of things, a third writ for ship
money appeared (9 Oct., 1636). It raised such a
storm of opposition in every quarter, however, that
Charles once more appealed to the judges for a formal
acknowledgment of his right. Their opinion proving<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
favourable,<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> the work went on and the City was
called upon (Sept., 1637) to furnish two ships each
of 700 tons.<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year, after Hampden's case had
been decided, Charles continued to levy ship money,
and the City was told to furnish a ship of 500 tons
(5 Nov., 1638). The cost was estimated at £1,000.
The usual precept was issued (26 Nov.) to the
alderman of each ward for the purpose of ascertaining
how best that sum could be raised.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> The returns
must have been unfavourable, for on the 29th January
(1639) the Court of Aldermen appointed a committee
to wait upon the lord high admiral and explain to
him that the City was not in a position to fit out
another ship.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> The money was eventually raised by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime troubles had arisen in Scotland
through Charles's ill-advised and bigoted attempt to
impose upon his northern subjects a Book of Common
Prayer. By midsummer (1638) he was preparing for
war and would shortly be under the necessity of
applying to the city for money and men. It was
probably with this end in view that he granted
(18 Oct., 1638) to the citizens an ample inspeximus
charter, confirming to them their ancient privileges
and franchises. Negotiations for a new charter had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been going on since the preceding March<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> (if not
earlier), and it was only now conceded on payment
of a sum of £12,000.<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the opening of the new year (4 Jan., 1639)
Charles applied by letter under his hand to the City
for a liberal contribution and assistance towards
putting down the disorders in Scotland, notifying at
the same time the fact that he had called upon the
peers of the realm to attend in person at York by the
1st April. The letter was read to the court of
Common Council on the 12th February, but the
matter seemed of so great importance that further
consideration of it was adjourned to the 16th, when
it was agreed to issue a precept to the alderman of
each ward to take steps for raising a free and liberal
contribution.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> A month elapsed, and notwithstanding
every effort of the aldermen, less than £5,000 was
got together. The aldermen were directed to renew
their efforts, but this only resulted in increasing the
amount by £200 or £220.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a> The whole amount was
so small that it was contemptuously refused. At the
beginning of April Charles found himself at York
with an indifferent army, and with little prospect of
being in a position to maintain even that army beyond
a very limited period.</p>

council, appeared with so few of his brother aldermen
that he was ordered to go back and to return on the
10th with the whole court. When they at last made
their appearance they were told that the king
expected from them no less a sum than £100,000.
The war was, if possible, more unpopular in the city
than in the country. The memory of the recent
confiscation of their Irish estates had not been
obliterated from the minds of the citizens by the
subsequent grant of a charter. The mayor and
aldermen replied that it was impossible to find the
money. The council told them that it must be done,
one of the lords declaring that they ought to have
sold their chains and gowns before making such a
reply. They were ordered to appear once more on
the 12th June with a final answer.<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the citizens were not indisposed to assist
the king, if left to themselves and not subjected
to threats and intimidation, is shown by the fact
that, in anticipation of the return of Charles from
the North, the Common Council voted him (31
July, 1639) the sum of £10,000 as a free gift in
consideration that the City had not contributed
anything to his majesty on his setting out, as had
been required, "albeit the counties and private personnes
both nobles and others had done the same."<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the close of the year (1639) the country
was agreeably surprised at the news that it was the
king's intention to summon a parliament. Parliament
opened on the 13th April (1640). Few of its members
could have served in the last parliament of eleven
years before, but although so long a time had elapsed
since the Commons had met, they had not forgotten
their old constitutional claims to have the country's
grievances redressed before proceeding to grant<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supplies. An offer to relinquish ship money proved
insufficient, and after three weeks the "short
parliament" was dissolved (5 May, 1640).</p>

<a name="toc57" id="toc57"></a><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">Attempt to force a city loan of £100,000, April-May, 1640.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some days before parliament was dissolved
every effort had been made by the king to get the
mayor and aldermen to lend him £100,000. This
being found impossible, the mayor, Henry Garway, or
Garraway, was directed to make out a list of the
wealthiest commoners. After several attempts to
negotiate with the aldermen individually, they were
summoned to appear in a body on Sunday, the 11th
April. Charles himself then told them that his
necessity at the time was so great that he must
borrow £100,000 of the City; that he must not be
denied; the money he must have at once, as it
would benefit him more then than twenty subsidies
granted by parliament afterwards. After the king had
finished speaking the Lord Privy Seal<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a> addressed them,
setting forth that a similar sum had been advanced
by the City to King James; that he himself, being
Recorder at the time, had lent £3,000 towards it,
and that the money had been repaid with interest.
The City, he continued, was rather beholden to his
majesty for taking the money and repaying it with
interest, than the king beholden to the City for lending
it. He further instanced the case of the City having
lent King Henry III a sum of £100,000 rather than
allow that monarch to pledge his crown and jewels to
the merchants of the Steelyard, and it was truly
repaid. To this the aldermen were not permitted to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
make any reply, but were sent away to advise together
how the sum should be raised.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Thursday, the 7th May, the mayor and
aldermen were again summoned before the council,
when they were told that, having failed to provide the
sum previously asked for, they would now have to
find £200,000. If the latter sum was not forthcoming
the king threatened to "have £300,000 of the city."
They were to come again on the following Sunday (10
May) and bring with them a list of the rich men of
the wards.</p>

<a name="toc58" id="toc58"></a><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">Four aldermen committed to prison, 1640.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day appointed they came, but brought
with them a petition to be excused making such a list
as that required. The excuse was not allowed.
Strafford is recorded as having lost his temper at the
obstinacy of the aldermen. "Sir," said he, addressing
the king, "you will never do good to these citizens of
London till you have made examples of some of the
aldermen," and recommended Charles, in his own
"thorough" way, to hang a few of them.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a> Charles
did not take the advice offered. He would have made,
however, the mayor resign his sword and collar then
and there but for the intercession of the bystanders,
and actually committed four of the aldermen to
prison, viz., Nicholas Rainton, John Gayre, Thomas
Soame and Thomas Atkins, for refusing to make a
list of those inhabitants of their respective wards who
were able to lend from £50 upwards.<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> One of them,
Alderman Soame, gave particular offence. "I was an<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
honest man whilst I was a commoner," he told the
king to his face, "and I would continue to be so now
I am an alderman." The other aldermen professed
their readiness to give in the names of the richer
citizens, but objected to rate them according to their
means.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both Garway and Sir Thomas Gardiner, the
Recorder, favoured the king. The latter was particularly
anxious that the City should lend the £100,000
originally requested, and did his best to get the
money advanced. For his zeal on this occasion, and
for "other high crimes and misdemeanours," he was
afterwards (1642) impeached.<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aldermen were not long kept in confinement.
Even before their committal the city was in a ferment,
and a placard had appeared posted up in the Exchange
inviting all who were lovers of liberty to assemble in
St. George's Fields in Southwark early on Monday
morning (11 May). Archbishop Laud was a special
object of hatred to the citizens, and against him the
mob directed their attack. As soon as the trained
bands, which kept order during the day, had retired
for the evening, the rabble marched to Lambeth.
Laud, however, had been warned in time, and had
made good his escape across the river to Whitehall.
The rioters finding themselves baulked of their prey
retired with threats of returning to burn down the
palace. For the next few days the city was under
martial law. A double watch was kept in its streets.
The companies looked to their store of powder and
match. A strict guard was kept over servants and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apprentices, and a warrant issued for raising 1,000
men of the trained bands, or as many more as the
lord mayor should think necessary "to suppress,
slay, kill, destroy and apprehend all such as should
be tumultuously assembled in or about Southwark,
Lambeth, Blackheath or elsewhere in parts adjacent."<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pending the negotiations for a loan, payment of
ship money had not been strictly enforced; but now
that threats and entreaties had failed to open the
purse-strings of the citizens Charles made a desperate
effort to exact ship money. On the 9th June, 1640,
the lord mayor and both the sheriffs were summoned
to attend the council to give an account
of the ship money due from the city. Why had it
not been paid in? The mayor replied that he had
sent his officers to collect, but few or none would
pay.<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> Upon the king telling him that he should
have distrained, the mayor remarked that one of his
predecessors in office, Sir Edward Bromfield, was still
a defendant in a suit in the King's Bench brought
against him by Richard Chambers for acting in that
manner, and was likely to be cast. "No man," said
Charles peremptorily, "shall suffer for obeying my
commands." Thus encouraged the mayor himself<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made a house-to-house visit the next day, accompanied
by the sheriffs, for the purpose of collecting
the money. Throughout the whole city, however,
only one man was found ready and willing to pay.
When the mayor ordered the sheriffs to distrain they
refused on the plea that it was the mayor's business,
not theirs. Entering a draper's shop the mayor
attempted to seize a piece of linen cloth; the owner
set about measuring it, and naming the price told the
mayor that if he persisted in taking it he should esteem
it a purchase and put it to his lordship's account.<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 19th July news arrived from the North
that the Scots were about to seize Newcastle—a very
serious matter to the Londoners, as they would thereby
be cut off from their supply of coal. Charles took
advantage of this, writes Dr. Gardiner,<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href="#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> and sent

loan of £200,000 were granted the citizens
would hear nothing more of the project recently
promulgated of debasing the coinage, a project which,
if carried out, would have worked great mischief to
the London merchant and tradesman. "Leaving the
Common Council to discuss the demand, the privy
councillors amused themselves by strolling through
the Cloth Exchange at Blackwell Hall. The owners
of cloth gathered quickly round them. They hoped,
they said, that they were not to be compelled to sell
for copper goods for which sterling silver had been
paid. After a debate of an hour and a half Cottington
and Vane were re-admitted, to be informed that the
Common Council had no power to dispose of the
money of the citizens."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having failed once more in this direction, and
driven to his wits' end for money, Charles applied to
the livery companies for a loan of £120,000. They were
told that the money was not required for the purpose
of making war, but only to enable his majesty to make
the more honourable peace, sword in hand. It would
be used to pay off the soldiers and so prevent them
pillaging the country after disbandment. Each company
was assessed according to its wealth; but most of
the principal companies pleaded inability to subscribe
on the ground that the Londonderry plantation had
"consumed their stocks." It was believed at the time
that not a tenth part of the money would be raised.<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Six weeks or more elapsed. The king and nobles
were at York holding a council. The City had been
brought into a better humour by a confirmation of its
rights (5 Sept.) to tolls known as "package" and
"scavage," and a pardon for all past offences in daring
to exact such tolls.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> The citizens were still better
pleased with a promise of another parliament which
Charles made in answer to a petition (24 Sept.),<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> and
with the prospect of a speedy conclusion of peace with
Scotland. Under these circumstances one last effort
was made to get them to advance the long-wished-for
loan of £200,000. Not only did the king and the
lords ride to the city, but the Earl of Manchester, the
Lord Chamberlain, Viscount Campden, and other lords
paid a personal visit to the Guildhall and used their
utmost powers to persuade the citizens to advance the
money. The money might be paid by two instalments
of £50,000 and one instalment of £100,000 between
October and December, and the Peers themselves
would give security for repayment.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> This time the
application was more successful, thanks to a little
high-handedness practised by the lords on the
Common Council. "With all diligence becoming us
we have gone upon the business wherewith your
majesty and the Peers entrusted us," they wrote to
the king (3 Oct.), giving him a long account of their
visit to the city.<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> "On Friday morning (2 Oct.) we
desired the lord mayor to call a Court of Aldermen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at Guildhall, whither we all went, sat with them in
council, and opened to them all our business, and
read our letters, which satisfied them very much,
yet they reserved themselves till they saw how it
would take with the Commons. Then we all went
to dinner with the lord mayor and there appointed
to have a Common Council that afternoon, amongst
which we mingled divers commoners that were not
of the Common Council, such as we knew well
affected and powerful in the city." We are not
surprised to learn that this action on the part of the
lords was strongly objected to as not being altogether
regular. The lords insisted, however, and they were
allowed to have their own way. "At three o'clock
that afternoon," the letter goes on to say, "we met at
Guildhall, sat with them in the Court of Common
Council, and according to our instructions acquainted
them with the proceedings of the Assembly of Peers,
and used the best rhetoric, which was plain remonstrance
of all the passages at York, not concealing the
admirable grace and freeness shown by your majesty
in this great council, to the infinite content of all the
Peers, nor the true affection shown to you by the
Peers." They first read the letter from the lords and
then that from his majesty. They feared lest some
words which his majesty had (falsely) been reported to
have uttered on the occasion of the late petition from
the City for a parliament might have an injurious effect,
so they had explained this and other matters, and the
Common Council appeared well satisfied. "We then
withdrew, that they before they rose might more
freely debate upon the way of raising the sum
desired, for we persuaded ourselves it would not be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
denied." They were not disappointed. Before the
council rose it resolved to make application to the
livery companies, and a draft of a letter was prepared.
A copy of this letter the lords forwarded to his majesty.
In conclusion they assured the king of the great services
done in the matter, more particularly by Garway, the
out-going mayor, the Recorder, and the whole bench of
aldermen, and suggested the advisability of sending
them a letter of thanks. If the letter were addressed
to the whole commonalty so much the better. This
suggestion was carried out.<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a> There was a difficulty
about the security for repayment of the loan. It
was at one time proposed that the queen's jewels
to the value of £100,000 should be taken in pledge,
but this suggestion was afterwards disavowed by
the city.<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Michaelmas-day an election of a new mayor
took place in succession to Garway. William Acton
was the senior alderman below the chair, but he was
set aside and Edmund Wright and Thomas Soame were
returned by the Common Hall. The former was
selected by the Court of Aldermen. This much and
no more we learn from the City's own record of the
election.<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> From other sources, however, it appears
that the election was a very tumultuous one; that the

elected and was afterwards discharged by parliament.<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href="#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The loss of an adherent in the mayor of London
did not affect Charles so much as the immediate
cutting down of the promised loan to the modest sum
of £50,000, an event which followed, if it were not
occasioned by, the election of Wright. The delay,
moreover, in forwarding to the city the writs for the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parliament—the Long Parliament—met as promised
on the 3rd November, 1640. Charles had
intended to nominate Sir Thomas Gardiner, the
Recorder, a devoted adherent of the Crown, as Speaker
of the Commons; but since the days of Heneage Finch
the City had failed to return its Recorder to parliament.<a id="noteref_424" name="noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">424</span></span></a>
Charles was therefore obliged to look elsewhere.
His choice fell upon William Lenthall, who was
the first to realise the position of a Speaker in times
of political controversy, and who throughout his
career acted up to his famous dictum, that "he had
neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak, save as the
House was pleased to direct him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as parliament met, Strafford, who was
only too conscious of his impending fate, determined
to take the bull by the horns, and to use every means
to induce the king to anticipate the blow by boldly
accusing the parliamentary leaders of treasonable
designs. His efforts were futile. Rightly or wrongly,
it was generally believed that he intended to establish
a military despotism in England, and that London was
to be brought into subjection. The way in which it was
all to be effected was even described by Cradock, one<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the city members, in a speech he made to the
House. It is certain that the citizens regarded him as
a deadly foe. They had not forgotten the advice he
gave to Charles respecting the aldermen, nor his
attempt to ruin their trade by depreciation of the
coinage. For weeks past the city had been in a
disordered state. On the 22nd October, the mob
having forced its way into the Court of High Commission,
some of the offenders were brought before
the mayor and aldermen sitting on a commission of
Oyer and Terminer; but the grand jury refused to
find a true bill. These abortive proceedings were
followed by a riot at St. Paul's.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href="#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a> Before the House
had been in session a fortnight Strafford was ordered
into custody.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The £50,000 which the City had advanced went
but a little way towards meeting the king's necessities.
The two armies in the north had to be paid, and
there was not the wherewithal to pay them. The
City was ready to lend a further sum of £25,000,
on condition that the Londonderry estate was
restored, the garrison in the Tower removed and
the ordnance dismounted from its walls. Unless
this were done, said Cradock, "such jealousies
would possess the city, it would hinder supply."<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a>
Parliament agreed to the loan being repaid, as a first
charge, out of the £100,000 ordered to be raised for
the relief of the army and northern counties;<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a> and
the Common Council lost no time in preparing a petition<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Nor was it only in their corporate capacity that
the citizens came forward to render pecuniary
assistance to the government. On the 21st November
Isaac Pennington, alderman of the ward of Bridge
Without, and one of the city's representatives in
parliament, announced to the House that his constituents
had subscribed £21,000 to the loan.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general feeling of distrust that prevailed was
heightened by an attack made upon a member of
the House who, in his capacity of a justice of peace,
had prepared a list of recusants, in pursuance of a
recent proclamation.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> So great was the alarm among
the Commons that Pennington offered the House a
guard of three hundred citizens, and at first there was
a disposition to accept the alderman's offer, but in
course of time better counsel prevailed and the idea
was abandoned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tendency of the city towards Puritanism at
this time was very marked. On the 28th November
Prynne and Burton entered London, and their entry
was made one long triumphal procession. This
circumstance was specially noted by the royalist
writer Clarendon as a remarkable "instance of the
unruly and mutinous spirit of the City of London,"
which he is pleased to term "the sink of all the ill
humour of the Kingdom."<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> A fortnight later (11 Dec.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the meetings held at Ripon between
English and Scottish commissioners for the purpose of
negotiating a treaty ceased (Oct. 1640), it was on the
understanding that they were to be resumed in London.
The Scottish commissioners accordingly came south,
and were lodged in the city in a house adjacent to the
church of St. Antholin, where they were visited by a
large concourse of citizens and magnificently entertained.<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a>
It was with no little satisfaction that the
success of the Scots had been watched by the majority
of the inhabitants of the city, and now that the
northern commissioners were in their midst the
citizens took the opportunity of showing them substantial
marks of favour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 12th January, 1641, the Scottish demands

not taken into consideration until the 22nd. After
much debate it was agreed in general terms that a

In the meantime the Speaker, Lenthall,
had written (15 Jan.) to the mayor directing him to
summon a Common Hall for the purpose of raising a
loan of £60,000 required for the army, and the
Common Council had agreed (18 Jan.) that the
amount should be collected from the wards.<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a> But<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before this could be accomplished an incident occurred
which threatened to jeopardise the loan. This was
the reprieve of John Goodman, a Roman Catholic
priest, who had been condemned to death. The
morning after parliament had agreed to raise money
for the Scottish commissioners alderman Pennington
rose in the House and declared that, in consequence
of Goodman's reprieve and other suspicious circumstances,
the City had resolved to lend nothing.<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> The
Lords as well as the Commons followed the initiative
of the alderman and made a joint demand for the
execution of the condemned priest. As he had often
done before, Charles again threw over the Catholics.
He announced his intention not to allow the increase
of Popery or superstition in the country; he would
forthwith issue a proclamation commanding Jesuits
and priests to leave the kingdom within a month, and
he was willing to submit the case of Goodman to the
decision of both Houses.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> Fortunately for Goodman,
the City and the Commons had higher game to fly at
in Strafford, and the humbler priest was allowed to
remain unmolested in prison.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 6th February the Speaker addressed a
second letter to the mayor to the effect that the
money was required sooner than it could be collected
by way of subsidies, as formerly suggested to his
lordship, and that consequently the House had
directed him to take steps for having £60,000 raised<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

coming in so speedily as was desired, the Speaker
wrote a third time (19 Feb.) to the mayor, directing
him to summon a Common Hall and to lay before it
the extreme urgency of affairs.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> The chief cause of the
delay in getting in the money was the dissatisfaction
felt in the city at Strafford's trial being put off so
long. The 17th February being at last fixed for his
trial, there was some hope that the money would
speedily now be forthcoming,<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> and the same day the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again there was delay in bringing Strafford to
trial, and it was not until the 22nd March that he
was arraigned in Westminster Hall, where alone room
could be found for the crowds that were anxious to
witness the proceedings. The mayor took steps to
prevent a rush of people to Westminster and to
suppress any riot that might arise. From five o'clock
in the morning until nine at night a double watch was
kept at the city's gates and landing stages on the
river. The trained bands were held in readiness,
whilst servants and apprentices were ordered to keep
indoors.<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> At the end of three weeks a Bill of Attainder<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The Lords would willingly have let matters rest here,
but the discovery of a design entertained by the
queen of bringing the defeated English army from the
north to Westminster to overawe the parliament, and
likewise of an attempt made by Charles to get
possession of the Tower that he might liberate
Strafford by force, hurried the unfortunate earl's end.
The citizens were determined not to rest until his
head was off his shoulders, and 20,000 Londoners
signed a petition addressed to both Houses (24 April)
demanding his execution on the ground that he had
advised the plundering of the city and putting it to
fine and ransom.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> The Peers deemed it advisable to
give way. They passed the Bill of Attainder and on
the 12th May Strafford was beheaded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lords had another pressing reason for giving
way, for until the citizens were assured that the full
penalty of the law would be executed on Strafford
they determined to stop payment of the loan. Writing
to Matthew Bradley on the 3rd May, the treasurer
of the army tells him "a strange story." "There is,"
he says, "money ready in the city, but none will be
delivered until justice be done upon my lord of
Strafford."<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> On that very day, the letter continues,
there had been a crowd of 10,000 well-to-do persons
at Westminster—"citizens of very good account, some<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worth £30,000, some £40,000" demanding justice
against Strafford and threatening to send their
servants the next day unless justice were speedily
executed. "Truly these unsettled times do much
trouble me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discovery of the so-called "army plot" had
in the meanwhile led to a preamble being drawn
up to a document known as the "Protestation," or
declaration in favour of the reformed religion, in
which the danger from the army was for the first
time clearly mentioned. The Protestation passed
the Commons on the 3rd May,<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> and on the following
day received the assent of the House of Lords.
On the 11th May a printed copy of this document
was introduced into the Court of Aldermen, when it
received the willing assent not only of the aldermen
present, but also of the Town Clerk and the City
Remembrancer.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a> On the 29th it was accepted by the
Common Council, and two days later the mayor
issued his precept for a house-to-house visitation to
be made in every ward for the purpose of getting all
the inhabitants of the city to give in their adherence
to it.<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the execution of Strafford somewhat
allayed the nation's fears of having "two armies
brought into the bowels of the kingdom," they were
soon revived by a second army plot. The armies
thus became a constant source of danger as well as
expense, and it was determined to disband them.
Charles could not withhold his assent, and a poll
tax was established for the purpose of raising the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessary funds. This was in July (1641).<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a> The
masters and wardens of the livery companies were
forthwith called upon to make a return in writing
of the names of every person who had been and
then was master and warden of each company; the
names of all the livery, yeomanry and freemen of
each company, noting in the margin of the return
those who had ever been fined for alderman or
sheriff, and the parish and ward in which each
individual member of the company resided. Every
alderman was likewise instructed to make a return of
the names of his deputy and common councilmen
of his ward; the names of every merchant-stranger
that kept house there, every English merchant and
factor, and every popish recusant; and finally the
names of everyone in the ward above the age of
sixteen years not otherwise rated.<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 3rd February the House had come to a
resolution that the sum of £300,000 might justly be
appointed as a "friendly assistance and relief" for the
Scots. The manner in which it was to be raised was
left for further consideration.<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a> It was now arranged
that £80,000 of that sum should be at once paid over
to them, and that on August the 25th they should
cross the Tweed. The City was called upon to
find £40,000—or one-half of the amount immediately
required—by Wednesday, the 28th July.<a id="noteref_452" name="noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">452</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
By order of the House of Commons (29 July) it
was to be repaid with interest out of the poll money
when levied.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a> So eager were the citizens to contribute
towards the work of ridding the country of the Scottish
forces before Charles should have an opportunity of
using his powers of persuasion upon them that there
was a difficulty in getting a sufficient number of tellers
to receive it.<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to this heavy drain upon their resources,
the citizens were called upon by the House of Commons
(31 July) to forthwith pay the sum of £3,000 which
they had undertaken to advance, upon the public faith
of the House, towards "the furnishing of the queen-mother
of France in her journey out of the kingdom."<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a>
Ever since October, 1638, Mary de Medicis
had resided at St. James's Palace, and had caused no
little discontent by her intermeddling in the affairs of
the country and the favour she displayed towards
Catholics. On her first arrival in London the citizens
had accorded her a hearty welcome.<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> The acknowledgment
that Charles subsequently made of his
gratification at the City's action on this occasion was
rendered somewhat ungracious by his requesting that
a gift of the value of £1,000, "or thereabouts,"
should be made to the queen-mother in further
demonstration of the City's love. After communicating
with the Common Council the Court of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Aldermen agreed to present her with a cup of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles had determined to set out for Scotland
on Monday, the 9th August, in spite of every effort
to get him to postpone his journey. So great indeed
was the fear of danger likely to be incurred if he
carried out his intention at this juncture that the
House of Commons determined to sit on Sunday to
contrive measures for avoiding the threatened risk—a
proceeding which they publicly declared they would
never have adopted, "but upon inevitable necessity,
the peace and safety both of Church and State being
so deeply concerned."<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> In answer to a fresh appeal
Charles consented to put off his journey for one day,
and on Tuesday (10 Aug.)—the day on which the
treaty with the Scots was finished and the queen-mother
left England—he set out for Scotland.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 28th August, when all danger in the north
appeared to have passed away and Charles had visited
both armies without appealing to them for assistance,
parliament decided to adjourn from the 8th September
until the 20th October. The Commons were in need
of rest after the excitement of the session, and the
necessity for an adjournment was increased by another
visitation of the plague,<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a> which had already driven
many members home without leave. The day preceding
the adjournment was appointed to be kept as
a day of thanksgiving for the peace; and, pursuant to
an order of both Houses, the mayor issued his precept
for shops to be closed and for the inhabitants of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the Commons separated they delivered
(26 Aug.) their judgment upon a petition<a id="noteref_461" name="noteref_461" href="#note_461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a> which the
City had prepared for them in January touching its
estate in Londonderry, of which it had been deprived
in 1635 by sentence of the Court of Star Chamber.
That petition set forth the unwillingness of the City to
undertake the work of the Ulster plantation. It had
only been undertaken at the late king's earnest desire,
and subject to special articles, the City absolutely
refusing to be bound by the general articles drawn up
by his majesty for ordinary undertakers. The Irish
Society and the companies had expended more than
£130,000 (exclusive of money laid out by tenants) on
their estate "in hope to have in the future enjoyed
some benefitt of their great cost and charge." The
city of Londonderry and the town of Coleraine had
been rebuilt, and the castle of Culmore repaired and
entrenched. Fifteen churches had been either built or
repaired, besides a "very fair" church and free school
which had been erected in Derry at a cost of more
than £4,000. Roads had been made which had
converted one of the most barbarous places in the
kingdom into one of the most civilised. The society
and the companies, the petition went on to say, had
enjoyed this estate without interruption until Hilary
Term a° 6 Charles I (1631), when the Attorney-General,
Sir Robert Heath, exhibited an information
against the mayor, commonalty and citizens of London
and divers individuals, suggesting that they had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
possessed themselves of the said lands and taken the
profits before any grant was made to them, and that
they had a greater quantity of lands than was intended
to be passed by the grant, and had by indirect means
procured divers privileges to be inserted in the grant
for which the Attorney General who passed the grant
had no warrant. Evidence of witnesses had been
taken on the matter, but before the cause came to a
hearing this information was dropt and another
exhibited in Hilary Term a° 8 Charles I (1633) against
the petitioners and the Irish Society, in which new
charges touching infringement of conditions of Letters
Patent were inserted, and upon these pretences the
Irish Society was adjudged by sentence of the Court
of Star Chamber in Hilary Term a° 10 Charles I
(1635) to pay a fine of £70,000 and to lose their
estate on the ground that the said Letters Patent
had been "unduly and surreptitiously obteyned to
the prejudice and deceipt of his majestie." The companies
refused to surrender their estates, and divers
lands belonging to the City and to the Bridgehouse
were seized to satisfy the fine, to the great prejudice
of the City. Being otherwise unable to redeem themselves
from the penalty of the Star Chamber sentence,
the companies were forced to consent to relinquish
their Irish estate and all arrears of rent, amounting to
£20,000. A <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scire facias</span></span> was brought in and judgment
allowed by default, whereupon the companies lost
their estates, whilst the mayor and commonalty and
citizens of London, although not parties to any patent
or plantation—having done no more than lend their
name for the better transaction of the business and
for the purpose of raising money for the plantation,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which otherwise could never have been effected—were
fined £70,000. Seeing that the matter reflected so
badly upon the justice of the late as well as the
present king, the petitioners humbly prayed that a full
investigation of the whole proceedings might be made
and justice done.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the nature of the petition which the
Common Council ordered in January (1641) to be
submitted to parliament. The House had its hands
too full to pay much attention to the City's grievance
until recently; but now, within a fortnight of their
adjournment for a well-earned rest, the Commons
declared<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> the sentence in the Star Chamber to have
been unlawful and unjust. They declared that, in the
opinion of the House, the citizens of London had been
solicited and pressed to undertake the plantation of
Londonderry, that the king had not been deceived in
the grant to the new corporation of the Irish Society,
that no breach of covenant (if any there were) had
been committed sufficient to cause a forfeiture of the
lands, that the Star Chamber proceedings were <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ultra
vires</span></span>, and that the citizens of London and all those
against whom judgment had been given in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scire
facias</span></span> should be discharged of that judgment and
reinstated as they were before the sentence in the
Star Chamber.</p>

on that account, perhaps, described by Clarendon as

days of Wright's mayoralty were days of sickness and
tumult in the city. Numbers of disbanded soldiers
from the north had made their way to London, where
they carried on a system of rapine and outrage. The
mayor issued precepts for search to be made in every
ward for suspected persons and disbanded soldiers,
as well as for keeping the streets well lighted at
night by candle and lanthorn, whilst public proclamation
was made by the king for soldiers to repair to
their own homes.<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464" href="#note_464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shortly after the House of Commons had resumed
its session attention was again drawn towards Ireland,
where a rebellion had broken out. Seeing how successful
Scotland had been in its resistance to England, the
Irish had determined to strike a blow for the recovery
of lands handed over to Protestant colonists, as well
as for religious liberty. Charles himself had held out
hopes of greater freedom to the Irish Catholics, who
saw no reason why they should be worse treated than
the rebellious Puritans of Scotland. The scene of
massacre and cruelty which followed has been described
by others, and remains to this day (in the words
of Carlyle) "a huge blot, an indiscriminate blackness,
one which the human memory cannot willingly
charge itself with."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as news of the outbreak reached parliament,
application was forthwith made to the City
for assistance. On the 3rd November lord mayor
Gurney issued his precept<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a> to the aldermen informing<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them that on the previous day divers lords and others
of both Houses of Parliament had come to the
Common Council and asked for a loan of £50,000
at eight per cent. Seeing that the matter was of
so great importance, each alderman was desired to
take steps in conjunction with his deputy and common
councilmen of his ward to get liberal contributions
made towards the loan.<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attitude of the City now became more
marked. Whilst consenting to find the money
required, it asked parliament that the persons of the
Catholic lords might be secured, and that the bishops,
who were the cause of every good measure being
defeated in the Upper House, might be deprived of
their votes. It had a minor grievance in the custom
that had arisen of members of both Houses granting
their servants "protections" against creditors, a procedure
extremely prejudicial to the city merchant and
tradesman, and one which they would willingly see
remedied.<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City's declaration against the bishops, which

point in the struggle," augured badly for Charles.
Nevertheless, he had friends in the city. The new
mayor was a strong royalist, as also were the
majority of the aldermen, and they took the
opportunity of Charles paying his first visit to the city<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(25 Nov.) since he ascended the throne to demonstrate
their loyalty. On the 17th the Court of Aldermen
appointed a committee to make the necessary
arrangements,<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a> whilst the mayor issued his precept
the same day to the civic companies to prepare a
certain number of their livery, well horsed and
apparelled, to assist him in escorting the king and
queen from the church of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, to
the Guildhall on the morning of the eventful day, and
thence, after the banquet, to Whitehall.<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a> The Common

There was some talk of presenting the king with a gift

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was of the utmost importance to Charles to
win over the city to his side if he could—"The loans<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the London citizens alone had made it possible
for the House of Commons to disband the armies;
and without the loans of the London citizens the
House would find it impossible to provide for a
campaign in Ireland," and thus place itself in a
position of military supremacy.<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a> Accordingly, in a

his gratification at finding that the better class of
citizens were still loyal. "I see," said he, "that all
those former tumults and disorders have only risen
from the meaner sort of people, and that the
affections of the better and main part of the city
have ever been loyal and affectionate to my person
and government." He proceeded to assure his
hearers of his determination to maintain the true
Protestant religion as established by Elizabeth and
James, and he hoped with the assistance of parliament
to re-establish the trade of the country. But what
pleased the citizens perhaps more than anything was
a promise he made to restore to them their Londonderry
estate—at that moment in the hands of the
rebels, but soon, he hoped, to be recovered. The
Recorder was expressly commanded to wait upon his
majesty and see that this promise was punctually performed.<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By way of further showing his favour Charles
knighted both the Mayor and Recorder on the spot.
He afterwards expressed his gratification at the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reception that the City had accorded him,<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Common Council took Charles at his word
and lost no time in appointing a committee for the
purpose of introducing a Bill in parliament for the
recovery of the city's Irish estate. The Recorder had
pointed out (20 Nov.) to the court that the "corporation"
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the Irish society) had been dissolved, and
it behoved them to consider in whose names the Irish
estate should be vested, whether in the name of the
mayor and commonalty of London or a "select company."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The disaffected element in the city, which had
voluntarily kept itself in the background, or had been
suppressed by force on the day of the king's visit,
again came to the surface as soon as the duties of
hospitality had been executed. Once more a crowd
gathered (29 Nov.) at Westminster, shouting "No
bishops!" encouraged (it was said) by John Venn, a
merchant taylor, who had succeeded Cradock, on the
latter's decease, as one of the city's representatives in
parliament. On the 10th December the mayor, acting
under orders from the king, issued his precept to the
aldermen to see that apprentices and servants were
kept within doors and not allowed to go abroad to
make tumult and hold unlawful meetings.<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href="#note_479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">479</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A difference of opinion existed as to the representative
character of those who had thus threatened
parliament. "You much mistake," wrote Thomas
Wiseman to Sir John Pennington ten days after the
riot had taken place, "if you think those seditious
meetings of sectaries and others ill affected, who
have lately been at the parliament-house to cry for
justice against the delinquent bishops, are the representative
body of the city—they are not, but the
representative body is the lord mayor, aldermen and
Common Council, who gave the entertainment to
the king and will stick to him and live and die in
his service."<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to dispel all doubts as to the respectability
of the agitators they determined to present a formal
petition to parliament for the removal of the bishops,
and to do the thing in style. "Accoutred in the best
manner they could," they rode to Westminster in
coaches, "to prevent the aspersion that they were of
the basest sort of people only which were that way
affected."<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> They declared that the petition was
signed by over 20,000 well-to-do citizens, including
aldermen and members of the Common Council, and
that many more signatures might have been obtained
but for the obstruction of divers "ill-affected persons."<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a>
When the Commons came to inquire (20 Dec.) who
these ill-affected persons were, it was found that the
Mayor and the Recorder were the chief. The former
was declared to have said that the petition had found<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
favour only with ignorant or idle people, who did not
realise the danger they were in, and that the petition
"tended to mutiny." On hearing that part of the
petition which stated that it was the wish of the
"representative body" of the city to have the bishops
removed, the Recorder lost all control over himself,
and swore it was a lie. The petition, he said, tended
to sedition, and to set men together by the ears. So
far from tending to peace it was, he declared, "for
blood and cutting of throats; and if it came to
cutting of throats, thank yourselves; and your
blood be upon your own heads."<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a></p>

(21 Dec.), the day on which the members of the
Common Council go out of office and present themselves
to their constituents for re-election. The result
of the elections turned out to be largely in favour
of the Puritan opposition. The new Common
Council, like the House of Commons, would support
"King Pym" and his policy; whilst the more
aristocratic Court of Aldermen would side with
Charles and the House of Lords.<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> It cannot be
doubted that the new council was more truly representative
of the inhabitants of the city, and better
able to give expression to their wishes than the last.
There was only wanting a popular lord mayor. He
was to come.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tardy and unsatisfactory reply Charles gave
to the remonstrance—the "Grand Remonstrance of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the state of the Church and Kingdom" presented
to him at Hampton Court on the 1st December—and
his appointment of Colonel Lunsford, a
debauched ruffian, as lieutenant of the Tower, in
place of Balfour, who was a favourite with the
city, increased the exasperation against him, and
the mayor was obliged to inform him (26 Dec.) that
unless Lunsford was removed he could not answer
for the peace of the city. This representation by
Gurney had the desired effect, and Lunsford was
removed that night.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a> Before his removal became
generally known another riot broke out at Westminster
(27 Dec.) between London apprentices and
some officers of the late army, among whom was
Lunsford himself. The officers drew their swords and
drove the close-cropt apprentices, or "roundheads"
as they were jeeringly called, out of Westminster,
chasing them up King Street as far as Whitehall.
Several of the rioters were hurt, but none killed. For
some days the excitement was so great that everyone
attending the court at Whitehall wore a sword;
and 500 gentlemen of the Inns of Court offered their
services to the king.<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> On the 28th December Charles
directed the mayor to call out the trained bands,
and to command their officers, "by shooting with
bullets or otherwise," to slay and kill such as should
persist in tumultuary and seditious ways and disorders.<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a>
The Peers were inclined to throw the blame of the
disturbance upon the civic authorities, but Pym and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the House of Commons refused "to discontent the
citizens of London, our surest friends," at such a
critical time.<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> Charles himself took the same view,
and sent a letter to the City by the hand of Lord
Newburgh, in which he expressed his continued
confidence in the loyalty of the city, and ascribed the
recent tumults and distempers to "the meane and
unruly people of the suburbs." The Common
Council in reply caused it to be signified to his
majesty that neither that court nor any individual
member of it was implicated in the late disorder,
which they altogether disavowed and disclaimed.<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a>
Having committed this message to Lord Newburgh to
carry to the king, the court proceeded to take measures
for the better preserving the peace in the several wards
of the city.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same day that these measures were being
taken for public safety in the city the Commons
directed halberds to be brought into the House for
their own use in case of a sudden attack, and desired
the king to appoint the Earl of Essex captain of the
guard. After this they adjourned until the 3rd January,
a committee being ordered to sit in the meanwhile
at the Guildhall. Upon the re-assembling of the
House Charles refused its request for a guard.<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> The
Commons thereupon sent a message to the mayor for
the trained bands to be put in readiness "for the safety
of the king's person, the city and the commonwealth,"
and for good and strong watches to be set at all<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
places convenient about the city. The following day
Sir Thomas Soame, Alderman Pennington and Captain
Venn were despatched to the city to inform the citizens
of a new danger which was threatening the Commons.<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the short recess Charles had at last made
up his mind to a course long premeditated. He
determined to seize the parliamentary leaders on
a charge of treason, and articles of impeachment
were drawn up against Lord Kimbolton, of the House
of Peers, and Pym, Hampden, Holles, Hazlerigg
and Strode, of the Commons. No sooner had the
Commons met than the Sergeant-at-Arms appeared
with orders to arrest the five members.<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a> As such
action affected the privileges of the House, a committee
was appointed to send a reply to the king in due
course. Baffled in this direction, the king despatched
a message to the lord mayor forbidding him to call
out the trained bands at the order of the Commons,
but only to raise such a force as might be necessary
to put down tumult and disorder.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a> Gurney was in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Commons met the next morning
(4 Jan.) they sent up the articles of impeachment to
the House of Lords as a scandalous paper. The king
in the meantime was taking steps to secure the Tower
and the city. He had heard that six pieces of
ordnance had been removed from the artillery yard<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and placed near the Leadenhall, and he wrote to
the mayor bidding him see that they were used
only for the guard and preservation of the city if
need be.<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a> It was these measures that caused the
Commons to send Soame, Pennington and Venn to
the city to inform the citizens of the impending
danger. On the afternoon of the same day Charles
himself appeared in the House, to the door of which
he had been accompanied by an armed retinue.
Taking his stand before the Speaker's chair he professed
sorrow for the necessity that had brought him
there. Yesterday he had sent, he said, a Sergeant-at-Arms
to apprehend certain persons accused of high
treason. He had expected obedience and not an
answer. Careful as he was and always would be of the
privileges of the Commons, they were to know that
there was no privilege in matters of treason. Failing
himself to discover those whom he sought, he turned
to Lenthall and asked him if they were in the House.
"Do you see any of them?" The Speaker's reply
was singularly apt. "May it please your majesty,"
said he, falling on his knee before Charles, "I have
neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this
place but as this House is pleased to direct me,
whose servant I am here." Casting one more
glance round the House, and finding that the "birds had
flown," the king withdrew amid cries of "Privilege!
Privilege!" and the House immediately adjourned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king could not allow matters to rest here.
The next morning, being Wednesday, the 5th January,
he set out for the city with a small retinue, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
presented himself at the Guildhall when a Court of
Common Council was sitting. The city's archives are
searched in vain for any record of what took place
on that memorable occasion, but we have a vivid
account of the scene handed down to us by an eye-witness,
Captain Slingsby, who, happening to meet
the royal party on its way to the city, turned back
and followed it into the precincts of the Council
Chamber.<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href="#note_496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a> Charles lost no time in coming to the point.
He had come, he said, to demand those persons
who had been already accused of high treason, and who
were believed at that moment to be lurking within
the city. He desired to bring them to a trial at law,
and depended upon those present for their assistance.
He was resolved to redress grievances and to preserve
the privileges of parliament, but he must "question
these traitors." After justifying the existence of a
guard at Whitehall and saying a few friendly words
to the aldermen, he invited himself to dinner with
one of the sheriffs, choosing the sheriff who was less
favourably disposed towards him, viz., sheriff Garrett.
The king's speech was followed by an ominous
pause. Then a cry, writes Slingsby, was raised in the
council, "Parliament! Privileges of parliament!" and
presently another, "God bless the king!" These
continued for some time, but he professes to be unable
to say which of the two was loudest. When silence
was restored the king asked that a spokesman should
make known to him their wishes. Thereupon a
member of the council arose and said, "It is the vote<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this court that your majesty hear the advice of
your parliament." This statement was at once
challenged by another, who cried out, "It is not the
vote of this court: it is your own vote." The king
replied by asking who it was that charged him with
not taking the advice of his parliament, adding that
he did take its advice and would continue to do so,
but, said he, "I must distinguish between the parliament
and some traitors in it," and these, he repeated,
"he would bring to trial—to trial." "No privileges
could protect a traitor from a trial." With this he
turned to leave the Council Chamber. On reaching
the outer hall he was again assailed with the cry
that had been made to ring in his ears all the way
from Whitehall to the city, "The privileges of parliament!"
Undaunted he made his way through the
mob to dine at Garrett's house, and later in the day,
amid the same cries, he returned to Whitehall.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Relieved of his presence, the Common Council,

expressing their regret for the continuation of the
rebellion in Ireland, the removal of the lieutenant of
the Tower, in whom all had confidence, the steps
taken to fortify Whitehall, and the recent disturbances
at Westminster, they represented to the king the
great increase of the fears of the citizens owing to
his attempt to seize the five members, the effect of
which was to prejudice the whole trade of the city
and the kingdom. They therefore humbly desired
him to take steps for the speedy relief of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Protestants in Ireland, to place the Tower in the
hands of persons of trust, to remove discredited
persons from Whitehall and Westminster, and not to
proceed against Lord Kimbolton and the five members
of the Commons otherwise than in accordance with
the privileges of parliament.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having ordered this petition to be engrossed and

Council proceeded to vote a sum of £2,000 for
the purpose of providing a stock of arms and ammunition
for the defence of the city in "theis tymes of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each alderman had already been directed to see
that the trained bands, 6,000 strong, were fully
equipt without the necessity of borrowing arms from
the city halls or elsewhere; a double watch with
halberds and muskets was ordered to be kept in
each ward by night and day, chains and posts which
were in any way defective were to be forthwith made
good, and hooks, ladders, buckets, spades, shovels,
pickaxes, augers and chisels were to be kept in
readiness in case of fire.<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a> Members of the Common

night an alarm was raised, and the mayor was asked
to call out the trained bands. On his refusal the
trained bands dispensed with his authority and turned
out on their own account. The panic quickly spread,
and every inhabitant, arming himself as best he could,
hastened to join them. In course of time the alarm<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
subsided, but the mayor was commanded by an Order
in Council (8 Jan.) to investigate the cause of the
alarm, and to secure the persons who had taken upon
themselves to call out the trained bands.<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> This Order
in Council was immediately met by a resolution of the
Grand Committee of the Commons sitting at Grocers'
Hall to the effect that the action of the citizens for the
defence of parliament had been in accordance with
their duty, and that anyone attempting to arrest them
for so doing was a public enemy. More than this,
the Committee declared that at a time when the king,
kingdom and parliament were "in very eminent and
apparent danger," it was the duty of the lord mayor,
aldermen and Common Council, or the greater number
of them, to make use of the trained bands or any
other forces of the city for the preservation of the
peace.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a></p>

satisfied most of the objections raised in the petition
by his speech to the citizens on the previous Wednesday;
nevertheless, he was willing to give a further
answer to the several matters objected to, being
persuaded that his so doing would be considered the
greatest proof that he could offer of his good
intention. His answer, however, in whatever terms
it was couched, was considered far from satisfactory<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the council, and preparations for resisting force by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Monday, the 10th January, a joint agreement
for the future defence of parliament and the city was
arrived at by the committee of parliament and a committee
appointed by the Common Council.<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a> The trained
bands were ordered to their colours and placed under
the command of Captain Philip Skippon, as sergeant-major-general
of the forces of the city. Eight pieces
of ordnance were to accompany the troops, and as
many citizens as could supply themselves with horses
were to serve on horseback. All this was done for
the safety of the "king, parliament and kingdom."
With the object of increasing the number of trained
bands, the mayor was authorised by the Common
Council (19 Jan.) to issue his precept for a return to
be made by the alderman of each ward (1) of the
number of men in his ward fit to find and bear arms,
and (2) the number of men fit to bear arms but unable
to find them.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href="#note_504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a> The Common Council agreed to pay

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile Charles committed the fatal
mistake of quitting London (10 Jan.), and parliament
had thereupon returned to Westminster (11 Jan.).
The appearance of the five members as they made
their way by water from the city to Westminster was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
greeted with shouts of joy and firing of volleys. On
entering the House they publicly acknowledged the
kindness extended to them by the City, for which the
sheriffs and the citizens received the thanks of the
Commons, and a promise of indemnity for their action
throughout the recent crisis.<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything now promised well for parliament
except the refusal of Sir John Byron, lieutenant of the
Tower, to submit to its orders. Once more the
seamen or mariners of London, who play no unimportant
part in the history of the city at political
crises, came forward. They offered to take the Tower
by assault. There was some talk of reducing the
fortress by starvation, and Byron confessed to secretary
Nicholas (22 Jan.)<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a> that if the measures had
been carried out he could not long have held the
place, determined as he was to sell both the Tower and
his life at as dear a rate as he could. No such strict
investment, however, took place. Skippon attempted
to win over a portion of the garrison in the absence of
the lieutenant, but failed. The Tower, however,
became less an object of fear to the citizens as its
stock of munition of war became less every day by
reason of shipments to Ireland.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was to Ireland that Charles looked for assistance
in his struggle with parliament. It behoved the latter,
therefore, to use its utmost endeavours to reduce that
country to subjection. A deputation from the House
waited on the Common Council (22 Jan.) with a request<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for a loan of £100,000. Whilst this request was
under consideration the mayor was directed by the
council to write to all the livery companies interested
in the Londonderry estate, and exhort them to
contribute bread and corn for the relief of the
plantation.<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href="#note_510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days later (24 Jan.) the City resolved not
to accede to the request. Answer was sent that
they were unable to raise money for a foreign war
by way of a tax, and it was hopeless to raise the
money by voluntary contributions. The House was
reminded that the City had already advanced a sum
of £50,000 on the express understanding that troops
should forthwith be despatched to Ireland, but none
had gone. The citizens would refuse to lend more
until assured that relief had been actually sent to
Londonderry. The House was further reminded that
the City was dissatisfied with the remissness shown
in disarming Papists and pressing of soldiers, as well
as in displacing the lieutenant of the Tower, and
appointing one well approved by parliament. A similar
representation was made to the House of Lords.<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 11th February a petition was presented to
the House of Commons by "divers of his majesty's
loyal subjects," offering to assist at their own charge in
putting down the Irish rebellion, provided that they
might have such satisfaction out of the rebels' estates
as should be thought reasonable.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a> The suggestion was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
readily accepted, and a scheme for opening a public
subscription passed through both Houses in a week.
The mayor lost no time in setting a subscription
on foot in the city.<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> The companies, to whom
application had been made a month before for
contributions of bread and corn, were now desirous to
know if they could limit their relief to those sufferers
on what was or had been their own estates in Ireland,
and not have it distributed among all his majesty's
distressed subjects in that country. The Common
Council declined to undertake to answer this question,
but recommended each company to appear before the
parliamentary committee appointed for the purpose
and make its own conditions.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href="#note_514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following day (3 March) the City was informed
that an Act of Parliament was already in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the struggle that had been going
on between the king and parliament as to who
should have control over the fortresses and the
trained bands or militia of the kingdom, resulted in
the Commons drawing up an ordinance conferring
power in each county upon persons, to be afterwards<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

ordinance"—as it was called—caused no little dissatisfaction
in the city as trespassing upon the authority
of the lord mayor, and a petition against it was drawn
up by a certain section of the inhabitants and presented
to both Houses of Parliament. The same was printed
and circulated together with the king's message to the
Houses against the ordinance.<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was no long time before application was again
made to the city for more pecuniary assistance. The
breach between king and parliament was rapidly
widening. Charles was known to be collecting forces
around him in spite of a formal prohibition by the
Commons, who now more distinctly asserted their
claim to sovereignty. On Thursday, the 2nd June, a
deputation of Lords and Commons presented themselves
before the livery of the several companies
assembled in Common Hall, and desired a loan of
£100,000 towards "the relief and preservation of the
kingdom of Ireland" and "speedy supply of the great
and urgent necessities of this kingdom." The money
was voted "most freely and with great alacrity," and
was to be raised by the companies according to their
corn assessment, as on previous occasions. On
the 4th June the Commons passed an ordinance
for security of the loan, and the thanks of both
Houses and of the whole kingdom were returned to
the city for its ready compliance.<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a> Two days later
(6 June) Gurney, much against his own inclination
we may be sure, was forced to issue his precept to
the companies to raise their several contributions.<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a>
The Grocers' Company raised their quota of £9,000
by voluntary subscription without demur. The
Merchant Taylors, on the other hand, who were
assessed at £10,000, whilst expressing themselves
ready to do their part in furnishing the loan, took
occasion to formally place on record their resolution
"that the Common Hall (consisting of the liveries of
this city) assembled in the Guildhall, London, hath<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 10th the Commons issued "propositions"
for the bringing in of money, plate, arms and horses
for "the defence of the king and both houses of parliament."
Those living in and around London within
a radius of eighty miles were allowed a fortnight; and
so great was the enthusiasm displayed for the parliamentary
cause that (in the words of Clarendon)<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> "it
is hardly credible what a vast proportion of plate
was brought in to their treasurers within ten days,
there being hardly men enough to receive it or room
to lay it in." It was in vain that Charles protested
and threatened the citizens with the loss of their
charter if they carried out the behests of the Commons.<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gurney's position as mayor had become more
and more an anomalous one every day. In July he
was impeached by the Commons for having published
the king's commission of array in the city. On the
12th August the Lords sentenced him to be imprisoned
during the pleasure of the House, and to be deprived
of his mayoralty,<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a> and at the same time ordered Sir
Nicholas Raynton to summon a Common Hall for
the election of a new mayor. A Common Hall was
accordingly summoned for the 16th, when Isaac<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pennington and John Wollaston being nominated by

With a rigid Puritan like Pennington in the mayoralty

before Charles set up his standard at Nottingham
(22 Aug.) in token that the Civil War had commenced.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the general opinion of both parties that
the war would be a short one. A deputation from
both Houses attended a court of Common Council
held on the 25th August. It had been decided that
an army should at once set out so as not to "prolong
or draw out a war," and in order to keep the field of
action at a distance from London. But arms were
wanted. The City was therefore asked to supply the
parliamentary forces with 6,000 muskets and 4,000
pikes.<a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href="#note_537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a> It was difficult to raise this quantity of arms
in the city without depriving the trained bands of their
weapons, a course which was entirely out of the
question. At first the halls of the various companies
were ransacked for arms; this having been done and
a deficiency still remaining, a house-to-house visitation
was resolved on.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It behoved the citizens to look to themselves at
this crisis; and accordingly the Common Council
resolved early in September to raise two additional
regiments of foot, each 1,200 strong, and four troops
of sixty horse for the defence of the city. In order
to defray the necessary charge parliament was asked
to sanction the setting apart of £25,000 out of the
money and plate subscribed by the inhabitants for the
general defence of the kingdom; and the House, not<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wishing to run the risk of losing the goose that laid

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Committee of Militia, to whom the defence
of the city was entrusted, took care—"with most
loyal intentions to his majesty," as they were
careful to make known—that the city's force,
consisting of forty companies in six regiments, was
properly exercised both together and by separate
regiments, one regiment "going abroad" weekly for
exercise. The action of the committee gave rise to
much adverse comment by royalists, and led to two
members of the committee, viz., Sir John Gayer and
Sir Jacob Garrard, withdrawing from it. At the
request of the committee the Common Council agreed
that the lord mayor and sheriffs should take the place
of the retired members, and at the same time signified
their approval of all that the Committee of Militia had
done for the defence of the city.<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Skippon and other officers were directed (6 Sept.)
to take a view of the city and liberties and inspect
the gates and posterns, and especially a passage
through the Bell Inn into the fields at Temple Bar.
They were to consider the advisability of stopping up
the less used passages as adding to the city's peril, and
of erecting more watch-houses in addition to those
about to be made at Moorgate and Bishopsgate.
They were further to report anything that might the
better conduce to the safety of the city and liberties
"in these times of great and eminent danger."<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a>

to put himself at the head of the parliamentary army
which (it was fondly hoped) was to make short work
of the royalists. He carried with him, we are told,
his coffin and his winding-sheet, together with his
funeral escutcheon, in token of his readiness to die in

monthly, and threatening to throw down their arms
unless paid.<a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a></p>

answer was made to the "Close Committee" of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

precept of the mayor.<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a></p>

real or constrained Roundheads." There were exceptions,
however, but these were to be found chiefly
among the wealthier and more aristocratic class of
citizens. They were stigmatised as "Delinquents"
or "Malignants," and as such were committed to
prison, and their estates seized to provide means for
protecting the city and carrying on the war. Out of
thirty-seven "delinquents" imprisoned in Crosby
House a month later, three at least were aldermen
of the city, viz., Sir William Acton, Sir George

the opportunity of mentioning a few city matters
concerning which he desired their lordships's advice.
In the first place he had received the king's writ for
proclamation of the adjournment of the next law
term, and he wished to know if he was to act upon
it. Secondly, there had been recently a riot at St.
Paul's, and the rioters had been committed to prison,
and he desired to know what proceedings should be
taken against them. Lastly, he had to complain of
the seditious character of the sermons preached at St.
Paul's, the preacher being appointed by the Bishop
of London. Indeed, they had been so bad that he
and his brother aldermen had ceased to attend. He
asked that the appointment of preachers might be
vested in the lord mayor, according to a former order
of their lordships. On the first two questions an
immediate answer was given. As to the proclamation
for the adjournment of the term, it had received the
sanction of the Lords, and therefore the mayor was at
liberty to publish it. Touching the rioters at St. Paul's,
they might be proceeded with according to law. The
question as to the appointment of preachers at St.
Paul's, that was a matter which required further
consideration.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first serious conflict between the forces of
king and parliament took place at Edge-hill (23 Oct.),
when both parties claimed the victory. With Charles,
however, rested the more immediate fruits of success,
for he had overcome the first obstacle that stood
in his way to London. That Charles did not
enter London as a conqueror was owing to the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
determined front shown to his forces by the trained
bands of the City, and the energy displayed by
the inhabitants at large. If anything were needed
to stimulate exertion on the part of the Londoners,
they found it in the reports which daily arrived
of country houses being despoiled by the royalist
soldiery. Few doubted that if allowed to enter
the city the wealth of London would be at their
mercy. "You see what is threatened you," said the
Earl of Holland to the citizens at the Guildhall, soon
after the battle, "you must know what to expect and
what to trust to; they intend you no lesse (and that
is to be believed) than the destroying of the city,
your persons and the preying upon your fortunes."<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a></p>

Sunday; nevertheless, the House sat and received a
deputation of Londoners, who, "in the name of the
Godly and active part of the city," placed their
persons, purses and estates at the command of the

that they would "man out every man his man and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto the parliamentary cause had been
supported by loans which were in name, if not in
actual fact, voluntary. The spasmodic nature of this
method of obtaining a supply of money for the army
proved a source of weakness. The Houses therefore
resolved to change it for the more effective system of
raising money by taxation. The rest of the kingdom
would thus bear its share of the burden, which until
now had been chiefly borne by the city of London.
Inhabitants of the city who had never before contributed
to so-called voluntary loans would now be
compelled to pay their quota. Those who had not
already contributed to the support of the army were
now compelled to do so, in money, plate, horse,
horsemen or arms. Every man was to be assessed<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to his ability, but no one was to be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime a deputation of members of both

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city was becoming more and more agitated
by party faction every day. Royalist and parliamentarian
openly acknowledged the side he favoured
by wearing a distinctive badge,<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> and disturbances
were of frequent occurrence. To many the state of
affairs had become little less than disastrous, owing to
the shutting up of shops and the stoppage of trade.
The new parliamentary taxation increased the general
dissatisfaction and made the citizens sigh for peace.
On the 12th December two petitions were laid before
the Common Council. Both petitions advocated
peace. One of them was objected to by the court
as too dictatorial in tone and as casting an aspersion
on parliament. They nevertheless ordered it to be
entered on record, "to the end their dislike might the
better appear."<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a> Whilst these petitions were under<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
consideration in the Council Chamber, which stood
almost on the same spot as that on which the present
new and handsome structure stands, cries were heard
proceeding from an angry crowd in the adjacent hall.
On all sides there arose a clamour for peace. The
lives of the lord mayor and the unpopular aldermen
were even threatened. The few soldiers who happened
to be present received some rough handling, and were
told to go and spend the money they had received
from the State at the tavern, for they should have no
more. At last a body of the city trained bands
arrived and order was restored. The Common Council
continuing its deliberations set aside both petitions, but
appointed a committee to draw up on its behalf two
other petitions advocating a cessation of hostilities, one
to be presented to the king and the other to parliament.<a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 19th December these petitions, which

of Parliament, the sheriffs and certain members of
the Court of Aldermen and of the Common Council
attending at the bar of the House of Commons and
publicly disavowing any other petition. Having
notified its approval of both petitions the House gave
orders that those who had been suspected of taking
part in the late tumult at the Guildhall should be
committed as prisoners to Lambeth House.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> A week

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having obtained the sanction of parliament to
present their petition to Charles, the Common Council
left it to the mayor to send whom he would to
"Mr. Secretary Falkland to learn his majesties
pleasure whether certeine citizens might with safety
repaire unto his highness" with the City's petition,
and in the meanwhile nominated the members of
the deputation who should wait upon the king if
Falkland's reply to the mayor's messenger proved
satisfactory.<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> The reply was favourable, and the
deputation set out for Oxford, where Charles had
taken up his quarters. On their return they reported
the result of their journey to the Common Council.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a>
They arrived in Oxford, said they, between one and
two o'clock on the afternoon of Monday, the 2nd
January (1643), and an hour later waited upon Lord
Falkland at his lodgings in New College. At five
o'clock the same evening they were admitted into
the king's presence and the City's petition was then
publicly read. The king professed satisfaction at
seeing them, for he could now be sure that certain
printed declarations of his would reach those for
whom they were intended. He questioned very much
the ability of the City to protect his person, seeing
that it was unable to preserve peace among themselves.
On Wednesday (4 Jan.) the deputation was dismissed
with a promise that Charles would send an answer
by Mr. Herne (or Heron), one of his own servants,
who would accompany them on their return. He
asked which was the larger assembly, the Common
Council or the Common Hall. On being told that
the latter were more numerous he directed that his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
answer should be read there, as he wished as many
as possible to be disabused and to know the truth.
Just when the deputation was about to set out from
Oxford on its return a printed paper purporting to be
the king's answer was handed to Sir George Garrett
and Sir George Clark as they sat in their coach.
The Common Council having heard the whole story
of the mission to Oxford deemed it expedient to inform
the House of Commons of the result, and to lay the
printed paper in their hands.<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a> This was accordingly
done on the 11th January, with the result that the
House directed the mayor to summon a Common
Hall for Friday, the 13th, to hear the king's reply.<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a>
When the Common Hall met at the appointed
time it was only to hear a long diatribe against the
heinousness of those who had taken up arms against
their king. All good subjects were called upon to
throw off their yoke, and to begin by arresting the
lord mayor and certain leading citizens who had been
guilty of treason. When this had been done, and not
before, he would be prepared to return to London
without the protection of his army, or, to use the
expression of the petitioners themselves, with his
"royal," and not his "martial attendance."<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a></p>

convincing the assembly of the king's real mind, and
that he had no intention to accept terms of peace.
The meeting was all but unanimous for continuing the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
war rather than submit to the degradation of their
mayor. A subsequent attempt by Charles to have his
reply circulated among the livery companies was
frustrated by an order of the House of Commons
(24 Jan.) which granted the sheriffs an indemnity
for refusing to execute the king's order.<a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the war was to be carried on it was necessary
for parliament to face the difficulty of getting a steady
supply of money. Up to this moment the new parliamentary
taxes had brought in nothing. Many of the
wealthier class of citizens absolutely refused to pay.
At a Common Hall held on the 17th January
Alderman Garway pointed out, in a very strong
speech, the danger which would beset merchants
trading with foreign parts if the king withdrew his
protection from them in consequence of the city
contributing to the maintenance of the parliamentary
army. His speech was followed by a great tumult,
and the meeting broke up amid cries of "No money,
no money! peace, peace!"<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The payment of the assessment made in November
last had been widely refused. The war had already
ruined many, and if some refused to pay on principle
others refused from sheer inability. Among the former
must be reckoned Sir George Whitmore,<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a> a royalist

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless application was made to the City
at this juncture for a loan of £60,000 to keep the
army from disbanding. A deputation from both
Houses of Parliament attended a court of Common
Council held on the 18th February, and assured the
citizens that the money would be repaid out of the
weekly payments which parliament had resolved to
impose upon every county in England.<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a> This would
be the last time, as they hoped, that a call of this kind
would be made upon the city. The council declared
its willingness to promote the loan, the members
present promising an immediate payment of £6,000.
Ministers were recommended to lay the matter before
their respective congregations on the following Sunday
and exhort them to contribute.<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A weekly assessment of £10,000 had been imposed
on the City, whilst a monthly rebate was allowed
of £3,000. The Common Council complained to parliament
that the City was over-assessed in comparison
with other counties, and suggested that the monthly
allowance should be raised to £4,000. They also
desired some security for the repayment of the loan
of £60,000. These and other proposals were laid
before the House as being "encouragements" for the
City to make the loan; and the House, in returning
thanks to the City for its readiness in the matter of
the loan, promised that the "encouragements" should
receive favourable consideration.<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of their financial difficulties the
Commons had been busy elaborating the propositions
for peace sent down to them from the Lords. At
length these were complete, and on the 1st February
were presented to the king. They were, however,
received by Charles with little favour, and the rest of
the month was consumed by both Houses in an
endeavour to arrive at a compromise at once satisfactory
to themselves and likely to be acceptable to the
king.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before fresh terms of compromise were formulated
the House was asked (23 Feb.) to consider certain
other propositions drawn up by the Common Council
of the city. These were three in number. The first
desired the reformation of the army. The second
demanded an indemnity to the citizens for their
adhesion to parliament. The third was a proposal
for a religious covenant and association for the defence
of religion and liberty in case the negotiations with
the king should fall through. To only one of these
propositions did the House give an immediate reply,
and that was the second. To this the Commons
returned answer that in the intended treaty with the
king such care would be taken for the indemnity of
the City and citizens of London and of the privileges
thereof as should secure them and "be a witness to
the present and future generations of their fidelity
to the king and parliament."<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the citizens entertained but little hopes of
a peaceful issue to the negotiations with Charles is
evinced by their resolving (23 Feb.) to carry out a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
comprehensive scheme of defence of the city and

parliament, which further allowed the civic authorities
to call upon the inhabitants of the suburbs as
well as of the city proper to contribute to the undertaking.<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a>
The City had a hard task to get subscriptions
in from the outlying districts, and was consequently
obliged to advance out of its own Chamber no less
than six sums of £2,000 each between the months of
March and July lest the work of erecting the necessary
fortifications should be brought to a standstill.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the face of this extraordinary expenditure the
City was the more anxious to get its weekly assessment
reduced. On the 1st March Colonel Venn, one
of the city's members, informed the Common Council
that the application to have the assessment reduced
had been made too late, but the House would allow
the City an additional monthly sum of £3,000 in aid
of its defences so long as the ordinance for a weekly

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 10th March a deputation from both
Houses, including Pym, informed the Common Council
of a message that had recently arrived from the Earl
of Essex to the effect that Prince "Robert" (Rupert)<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had arrived with a large force within four miles of
Bristol, and the earl intended forthwith to make an
advance. His army, however, was sadly in arrears of
payment; he wanted both men and money, and this
fact he had desired to be represented to the citizens
of London. Pym, therefore, in the name of both
Houses desired the Common Council to hasten as far
as possible the payment of the residue of the £60,000
already promised, and to furnish such forces as the
city could spare.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">The City's answer to a request for men and money.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As far as the first part of the request went the
council promised its ready assistance.<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a> It frankly
acknowledged that little more than one-third of the
whole amount promised had come in, but there were
difficulties in the way of getting it in. A large sum
of money—as much as £30,000—which ought to
have been repaid to the lenders out of the estates of
malignants was still owing, and lenders were thereby
discouraged. Men of ability refused to lend, and
there were no means of forcing them; whilst divers
rich men had left the city, carrying with them what
property they could, and leaving their houses empty.
Nevertheless, the council assured the deputation that it
was well affected to parliament, all but a very few of
its members having already contributed, and it would
forthwith take steps to get the money in. Touching
the furnishing of soldiers, the council remarked that
there were but three regiments in the city besides
the trained bands, two of which were on active service
and the one remaining was on outpost duty.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after the outbreak of the war it was seen
that the weak point of the parliamentary army lay in
its cavalry. Already something had been done towards
remedying this defect. Volunteers had offered themselves
for the formation of a troop of horse at their
own expense, and a "seminary" for cavalry had been
established.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> The news about Rupert urged the
citizens to a greater effort. On the 15th March an
offer was made to the Common Council to raise no less
than ten volunteer regiments, three of which were to
consist of cavalry. The men were to receive no pay
except when engaged on active service, and only a
small sum was asked for, in order to provide colours,
drums and other necessaries. The offer was gladly
accepted.<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days later the negotiations between parliament
and the king for a cessation of hostilities
collapsed, and the parliamentary commissioners at
Oxford were ordered to return home (14 April).<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a>
Irritated at the king's obstinacy, the Puritan party
vented its spleen by ordering the wholesale destruction
of superstitious or idolatrous monuments in Westminster
Abbey and elsewhere. The City followed suit
by asking parliament to sanction the removal of
Cheapside cross, "in regard of the idolatrous and
superstitious figures there about sett and fixed."<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a> In

been set up in their place. The demolition of the
cross, which took place on the 2nd May amid signs of
public rejoicing, was followed (10 May) by the public
burning of the "Book of Sports" by the hands of the
common hangman in Cheapside.<a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a> Another measure
in the same direction was the placing of the appointment
of preachers in St. Paul's Churchyard in the
hands of the mayor and aldermen, a proposal which
the mayor had formerly suggested to the House of
Commons.<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that all hopes of a peaceful settlement had
gone, Charles took measures to gain over as many
Londoners as he could to his side. He had previously
(16 March) caused a commission of array to be drawn,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
addressed to Gardiner, who was still Recorder, and
others, authorising them to raise a force on his behalf
in the city.<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href="#note_596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a> This commission he had retained at
Oxford until he could find an opportunity for conveying
it safely to London. It was now entrusted to Lady
Daubeny to carry to London. She succeeded in her
mission and handed the document over to a city
linendraper named Chaloner, who, in his turn,
transferred it to Tompkins, a brother-in-law of Waller
the poet, who was also implicated in the design which
on that account came to be known as "Waller's Plot."
Tompkins endeavoured to conceal it in a cellar, but it
did not escape the prying eyes of parliamentary
searchers. Early in the morning of the 31st May
Tompkins was arrested, and in the course of time both
he and Chaloner paid the penalty of their rashness by
being hanged in front of their own houses, the one
in Cornhill and the other in Holborn. Waller was
also taken and flung into prison.<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href="#note_597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thursday, the 15th June, was appointed to be

or covenant, binding those who took it to support the
forces raised in defence of parliament against those
raised by the king, was generally accepted in the
city.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime Essex had besieged and taken
Reading (26 April), but his troops became affected
with disease, and he made no attempt to advance on
Oxford until June.  Before his arrival Hampden had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
received a mortal wound at Chalgrove Field (18 June).
On the 5th July the royalist forces under Hopton
worsted the parliamentary army under Waller in the
west, whilst a similar success was achieved against
Fairfax in the north (30 June). The king had reason
to be elated as he rode into Oxford (14 July)
accompanied by the queen, from whom he had been
separated for fifteen months, amid the shouts of men
and the ringing of bells.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parliament and the City, on the other hand,
had reason to be dejected. On the 17th July Charles
issued a proclamation for seizing all merchandise on
its way to London. The trade of the city became
paralysed.<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> Nor was this all. For some months
past the citizens had been suffering from a scarcity of
coal. Ever since the appointment of the Earl of Newcastle
as governor of the town of Newcastle in June,
1642,<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a> that town had been held for Charles, and a
refusal to allow its coal to be supplied to the
supporters of parliament had brought the city of
London and the eastern counties into great straits.<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a>
It thus became a matter of prime importance that
Newcastle should be captured. How this was to be
accomplished was set out in a series of propositions
drawn up (25 May, 1643) by the Common Council of
the city to be laid before parliament.<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a> A monopoly
of the trade in coal, salt and glass with the north of
England was to be held out as an incentive for
persons to adventure their money in the reduction<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the town. A committee, of which one-half of its
members was to be nominated by the Commons and
the rest by the City, was to have charge of all the
money subscribed and to direct the undertaking. The
propositions were well received (26 May),<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> and on
the 10th June the Common Council nominated three
aldermen and seven common councilmen to join with
a like number to be appointed by parliament in
raising a force by sea and land for the reduction of
the town.<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To make matters worse news arrived on the
18th July that royalist cavalry were in the vicinity
of London, and that great disaffection to the cause of
parliament had manifested itself in the neighbouring
counties of Kent and Surrey. The Common Council,
recognising the danger, forthwith resolved to raise
what money it could at the rate of eight per cent.,
and to place it at the disposal of the Committee of
the Militia of the city.<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The danger which threatened London was
increased the more by reason of dissensions which
sprang up among those whose particular care were
the defences of the city. A sub-committee which
usually met at Salters' Hall fell out with the Committee
of the Militia of London for presuming to get into
its hands the sole power over the auxiliary forces
which had lately been raised. Another committee
was appointed to investigate the cause of dissension,
and if possible to suggest a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus vivendi</span></span>.<a id="noteref_606" name="noteref_606" href="#note_606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a> This was
no easy matter to accomplish. It was eventually<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
agreed to lay before parliament a petition that all the
forces raised within the city and liberties, as also
within the parishes adjacent mentioned in the weekly
bill of mortality, might be under the sole command
of the Committee of the Militia of the city, under the
direction of both Houses of Parliament.<a id="noteref_607" name="noteref_607" href="#note_607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">607</span></span></a> On the
18th July a petition to this effect was accordingly
laid before the Commons by a deputation of aldermen
and common councilmen, and received the approval
of the House. The outcome of all this was that the
House eventually passed a resolution (29 July) that
"Sir William Waller do command in chief all the
forces raised within the city of London, and all
other forces that are or shall be under the command
of the militia of London, subordinate to the lord
mayor and militia," and at the same time transferred
the custody of the Tower into the hands of the lord
mayor and sheriffs.<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Waller's appointment was a distinct slur upon
Essex, about whom some rumours had been spread in
order to prejudice him in the eyes of the City. The
Common Council took an early opportunity of deprecating
strongly these false rumours, and appointed
(1 Aug.) a deputation to wait upon "his excellency"
to assure him of the good opinion which the court—as
the representative body of the city—had of his
great care and fidelity in the preservation of the
king, parliament, city and kingdom, and to promise
him every assistance in recruiting his army. The
citizens would stand by his excellency with their lives
and fortunes.<a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609" href="#note_609"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taking advantage of a split in the parliamentary
camp, the Lords renewed their proposals for peace.
As soon as the City became aware of this there was
great consternation. A Common Council hurriedly
met on Sunday afternoon (6 Aug.) and drew up a
petition to the Commons praying them to continue
the same course they had hitherto pursued and to
reject all propositions for peace.<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href="#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a> This petition was
presented to the House on Monday (7 Aug.), when
the proposals of the Lords came on again for consideration.
The House thanked the City for its care,
recommended the lord mayor to take measures to
prevent all disorders, and afterwards formally rejected
the peace propositions.<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href="#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a></p>

consideration the approaches of the Houses had been
filled by an angry mob which threatened to return
the next day unless matters went as they pleased.
On the morning of the 8th August parliament was
again besieged. This time it was by a crowd of
women with white ribbons in their hats, shouting
loudly for peace. The next day they appeared
in greater numbers, and having presented a petition
for the cessation of the war and received a courteous
answer from the Commons, they refused to go
home, but pressed on to the door of the House
and demanded that the traitors who were against
peace might be handed over to them. From words
they resorted to stones and brickbats. At length
a small body of Waller's horse from the city<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appeared on the scene, and order was with difficulty

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of marching with his main army direct

intended, he resolved to lay siege to Gloucester. On

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day after Gloucester had been summoned
to surrender the Common Council, in view of "the
neare approach of the king's forces," resolved to call
upon the livery companies to raise the sum of £50,000,
for which the City would give bonds at the rate
of eight per cent. interest. The companies were to
contribute according to their corn assessment. In
addition to this every inhabitant of the city, citizen or<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stranger, was to contribute to the Chamber a sum
equal to fifty times the amount of subsidy he had
been in the habit of paying, and for this also the City
would allow him interest at the rate of eight per cent.
after the first six months. This mode of raising the
money required subsequently (18 Aug.) received the
sanction of both Houses of Parliament, who guaranteed
its repayment (24 Aug.).<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href="#note_616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a> The Merchant Taylors'
Company again hesitated before they consented to
pay the sum (£5,000) at which they were assessed,
whilst the Grocers, on the other hand, displayed the
same alacrity as before in contributing their quota

their plate (with the exception of such as was
absolutely necessary) for the purpose.<a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href="#note_617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a></p>

Houses, Essex set out on his march (26 Aug.). The
troops suffered great privation from lack of food and
water by the way. "Such straits and hardships,"
wrote a sergeant in one of the London regiments,
"our citizens formerly knew not; yet the Lord that
called us to do the work enabled us to undergo such
hardships as He brought us to."<a id="noteref_619" name="noteref_619" href="#note_619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">619</span></span></a> By the 5th
September every obstacle had been overcome and
Essex appeared before Gloucester, only to see, however,
the blazing huts of the royalist army already in
full retreat. Three days later he entered the city
amid the enthusiastic rejoicings of the inhabitants,
who, but for his timely arrival, would have been at
the mercy of the enemy. The relief of Gloucester,
to which the Londoners contributed so much, "proved
to be the turning point of the war."<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href="#note_620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the Londoners fairly claimed some credit for
the part they had taken towards the relief of
Gloucester, still more credit was due to them for the
bold stand they made a fortnight later (20 Sept.), at
Newbury, against repeated charges of Rupert's far-famed
cavalry. Again and again did Rupert's horse
dash down upon the serried pikes of the London
trained bands, but never once did it succeed in breaking
their ranks, whilst many a royalist saddle was emptied
by the city's musketeers, whose training in the Artillery
Garden and Finsbury Fields now served them in good
stead. Whilst the enemy's cannon was committing<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fearful havoc in the ranks of the Londoners they still
stood their ground "like so many stakes," and drew
admiration even from their enemies for their display
of courage. "They behaved themselves to wonder,"
writes the royalist historian of the civil war, and
"were, in truth, the preservation of that army that
day."<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href="#note_621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> Notwithstanding, however, all their efforts,
the day was undecided. Neither party could claim a
victory. Essex was glad enough to make his way to
Reading, whilst Charles retired to Oxford. On their

an enthusiastic welcome, the mayor and aldermen
going out to meet them at Temple Bar.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ten days later the services of the trained bands
were again required to assist in regaining the town of
Reading, which had been occupied by the royalists
as soon as Essex had quitted it. Six regiments were
to be despatched for the purpose. Two regiments of
the city's trained bands were chosen by lot, as before,
and the remainder of the force was made up out of
the auxiliaries and the trained bands of Southwark
and Westminster.<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href="#note_622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> Orders were issued that if any

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In no long time a mutinous spirit broke out
among the trained bands, who, in the midst of an
attack on Basing House, the mansion of the Marquis
of Winchester, in the following month insisted upon
returning home, and the siege had to be abandoned.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
On the 28th November the sheriffs of London, accompanied
by a deputation of aldermen, appeared at the
bar of the Commons and boldly desired that the city
regiments with Essex might be called home. Alderman
Fowke or Foulke, a leading spirit in the city and
staunch parliamentarian, was one of the sheriffs at
the time, and acted as spokesman. He laid before the
House a plain statement as to how matters stood.
The fact was that the troops were unpaid, and that no
money was forthcoming. If money was found for the
trained bands the civic authorities, in consideration of
the critical times, promised to do their best to persuade
them to remain longer in the field. The House resolved
to raise £5,000 for the city's forces on this understanding.<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href="#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a>
A month later (30 Dec.) the Common Council
formally approved of a request made by both Houses
of Parliament that two or three regiments of the
trained bands should be sent to reinforce Waller, who
was endeavouring to recapture Arundel.<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href="#note_625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The recent signs of disaffection encouraged Charles
to make another effort to win over the City, and in
this he was promised the support of Sir Basil Brooke.
Whilst accepting the services of one who was a warm
Catholic, Charles addressed a letter to the mayor and
aldermen, in which he assured them of his "constancy
in religion." He foolishly imagined that such an
assurance would induce the City to break at once with
parliament and declare for peace. The letter, as luck
would have it, fell into the hands of the Committee
of Safety. The plot was discovered, and full particulars
of it laid before the Commons (6 Jan., 1644).<a id="noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discovery led to stricter precautions being
taken to prevent inhabitants of the city leaving the
city to join the king at Oxford, as many ill-affected
persons had already done. The number of passes
was reduced, and the keys of the portcullises of the
city's gates were ordered for the future to remain in
the custody of the sheriffs.<a id="noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a></p>

the Common Council resolved (12 Jan.) to invite both

place at Merchant Taylors' Hall (18 Jan.), was
preceded by a sermon preached at Christ Church,
Newgate, in favour of union. The preacher, Stephen
Marshall, received the formal thanks of the City,
besides a "gratification," and was desired to print his
sermon. On their way from church to the banquet
the Lords and Commons passed through Cheapside,
where a pile of crucifixes, pictures and popish relics
were in the act of being burnt on the site of the
recently destroyed cross.<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href="#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a> The City afterwards

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day following the banquet the first regiments
of the Scottish army crossed the Tweed, driving the
royalists of the extreme north of England to take
shelter in Newcastle. The mutual understanding
between England and Scotland—the result of Pym's
policy—necessitated the appointment of some definite
authority at Westminster which should control both
armies in common. Hence it was that on the 16th<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
February a Committee of Both Kingdoms, composed
of members of parliament and commissioners sent
from Scotland, was established to take the place of
the Committee of Safety.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the City was busy increasing its

were the authorities driven for money to pay the
troops that they could devise no better method than
that the inhabitants of the city should be called
upon to set apart the price of one meal every week
for the purpose. The idea was at first distasteful to
the Common Council, but seeing no other alternative
open they eventually applied for and obtained the
sanction of parliament to carry it out.<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href="#note_631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">631</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The council at the same time signified to
parliament its regret that those reforms in the army
which it had expressed a wish to have carried out,
had not been effected, and humbly prayed that Essex
might be furnished with a force such as the necessity
of the times demanded, that command might be given
to officers whose fidelity was beyond suspicion, and that
such discipline might be maintained in his excellency's
army as might make it a pattern of reformation to all
the rest of the armies of the kingdom.<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href="#note_632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">632</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spring campaign opened successfully for
parliament. When news of Waller's success at
Cheriton (29 March) reached London it was received<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with enthusiastic joy, and, for a time at least, all
thoughts of peace were set aside. The City assisted
parliament to raise a sum of £20,000 (3 April) and
authorised the purchase of 3,000 muskets and 1,000
pikes on the credit of the weekly meal money
(3 April).<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href="#note_633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a> The Commons ordered a public thanksgiving
for the victory which had crowned their arms
to be kept in London on the 9th April,<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> and the
mayor was instructed to summon a Common Hall to
meet in the evening of that day for the purpose of
hearing proposals from both Houses. All the
advantages gained at Cheriton were unfortunately
lost by the city's trained bands again insisting upon
returning home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Common Hall which was accordingly

the speeches were pitched in the same strain. The City
was thanked for its past services and exhorted to
embrace the opportunity that now offered itself of
putting an end to the existing distractions. It was
purposed to draw all available forces together to
a general rendezvous at Aylesbury by the 19th of the
month, and the citizens were desired to offer themselves
"as one man," for it was to no purpose "to go
by little and little."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three days later (12 April) the Committee of
Militia, which had recently received (8 April) a fresh
commission, was instructed to call out six regiments
of the auxiliaries. Three of them were to set out<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
immediately to join the parliamentary army, whilst
the other three were to be held in reserve.<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href="#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">636</span></span></a> It was
to little purpose, however, that the City kept sending
out fresh forces, if these were to be continually
insisting upon returning home, as those under Waller
had recently done for the second time.</p>

<a name="toc113" id="toc113"></a><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">Three regiments ready to march, 2 May.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great delay took place in getting the parliamentary
forces into the field. The 19th April, the
day appointed for the rendezvous at Aylesbury,
arrived and found Essex still unprepared. It was not
until the 2nd May that the Committee of the Militia
of the city informed the Common Council that three
regiments out of the six to be called out were then in
readiness to march. The committee asked the sanction
of the council before giving orders for the regiments
to start because, they said, their powers had
been much limited by their last commission (8 April).
The council was in favour of the regiments setting
out at once towards Uxbridge, according to instructions
left behind by Essex, and the committee was
directed to draft an ordinance for parliament to the
effect that none of the forces might be kept longer
abroad or sent further from London than the committee
should from time to time think fit, and that
the forces should be conducted and commanded by
such major-general and other officers of the brigade
as the committee should appoint.<a id="noteref_637" name="noteref_637" href="#note_637"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">637</span></span></a> It was a repetition
of the old story. The City always insisted on appointing
its own officers over its own men.</p>

would at once satisfy both Houses as well as be
acceptable to Charles. At length the proposals
were laid before the Commons and read the first
time (29 April). The second reading was appointed
for the 1st May. Before any further steps were
taken in the matter it was but right that the citizens
of London, without whose aid the issue of
the struggle between king and parliament might
have been very different to what it was, should be
consulted. A deputation was therefore appointed
(3 May) by the House to wait on the mayor,
aldermen and common council of the city and
to express to them the willingness of parliament to
consider any proposals that they might think fit to
make on behalf of the city, and to lay them before
the king.<a id="noteref_638" name="noteref_638" href="#note_638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> The City thanked parliament and referred

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some time past there had been a flow of
dissatisfied royalists from Oxford to London, induced
to embrace the parliamentary cause by an offer
of pardon made by Essex (30 Jan.) to all who
would return to their duty and take the covenant.<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href="#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a>
During 1643 the flow had been in the opposite direction.
It now became necessary to see that only
genuine converts found their way into the city, and to
this end parliament ordered (15 May) the mayor to
take steps for the expulsion from the city and lines of
communication of all suspicious persons such as had
lately come from Oxford, or any other of the king's
quarters, all recusants, the wives of recusants and the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the term of three months for which
the Committee of Both Kingdoms had been originally
appointed was fast drawing to a close, and considerable
difference of opinion had manifested itself
between the Lords and Commons as to its re-appointment.
The former were in favour of increasing the
numbers of the committee, with the view no doubt of
giving a larger representation to the peace party,
whilst the latter advocated a simple renewal of the
powers of the committee as it then stood. At this
juncture, when the country seemed likely to be left
without any central authority to direct the movements
of the parliamentary forces, the City presented
a petition (16 May) to the Commons<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a> setting forth
the danger that was likely to arise from the discontinuance
of the committee, and praying that it might
speedily be re-established as the present urgency of
affairs required. The citizens took the opportunity of
praying the Commons to see that the Tower of London,
Windsor Castle and Tilbury Fort remained in
good hands and were properly supplied with necessaries,
and further that none of the members of the
House who had returned from Oxford might be readmitted
to their seats until they had given satisfactory
pledges for their fidelity in the future. The
re-admission of these members had been a cause of a
long wrangle between the two Houses.</p>

They gratefully acknowledged the assistance they had
received from the city, without which they would have
been unable to achieve what they had done. An
ordinance, they said, was being proceeded with for
the continuance of the Committee of Both Kingdoms;
measures would be taken respecting the Tower,
Windsor Castle and Tilbury Fort such as would be for
the security and satisfaction of the City; and the
House had already passed an ordinance touching the
re-admission of members which it would see carried
into execution. The answer concluded by again
acknowledging the obligation that parliament was
under to the City for spending its blood and treasure
for the public good, which the House would ever
have in remembrance and would endeavour to requite.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as matters were coming to a dead-lock the
crisis was averted by the happy thought of reviving
an old ordinance which had already received the
sanction of the Lords, but had hitherto been ignored

which proposed to confer unlimited powers on the
committee, was now taken up and passed by the
Commons, and thus the old committee was enabled

on the 27th May appointed a committee, of which the

members, to consider how best to raise it, "either by<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

war appeared to be approaching a crisis. The town
of Abingdon had recently been abandoned by the
royalists and occupied by Essex, whilst Waller was
advancing in the direction of Wantage, to gain, if
possible, a passage over the Thames above Oxford,
and thus cut off Charles from the west of England.
Both generals sent notice of their movements to
parliament, and on the 28th their letters (or an
abstract of them) were read before the Common
Council by a deputation of the recently appointed
committee, and a request was made that the City
would furnish the House with a sum of £200,000
or £300,000 upon the security of the estates of
delinquents. Notwithstanding the difficulty the City
was then experiencing in getting in the arrears of the
monthly assessment and the weekly meal account, it
at once took steps to carry out the wishes of
parliament.<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href="#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 7th June information was brought to the
City that Charles had been forced to flee from Oxford,
and the Common Council was asked to render assistance
in the reduction of the king's stronghold.<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href="#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a> As long as
Charles was at large, not only was the prospect of an
end of the war more than ever remote, but the safety
of London itself was threatened. It was a time for
Essex and Waller to forget all past differences and to
strengthen each other in a joint attack upon the
royalist army wherever it may be found. Instead
of this the two generals went different ways; Essex
marched westward, leaving Waller to pursue Charles
as best he could. To make matters worse, disaffection
again appeared in the ranks of Waller's army.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href="#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the city trained bands had done good service
in their day no one will deny, but the time was fast
approaching when it would be necessary to raise
an army of men willing to devote themselves to
the military life as a profession. For permanent
service in the field the London trained bands were not
to be relied on. "In these two days' march," wrote
Waller (2 July) to the Committee of Both Kingdoms,
"I was extremely plagued with the mutinies of the
City Brigade, who are grown to that height of
disorder that I have no hope to retain them, being<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
come to their old song of Home! Home!" There
was, he said, only one remedy for this, and that was
a standing army, however small;—"My lords, I
write these particulars to let you know that an army
compounded of these men will never go through
with your service, and till you have an army
merely your own, that you may command, it is in a
manner impossible to do anything of importance."<a id="noteref_651" name="noteref_651" href="#note_651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">651</span></span></a>
The junction of his forces with those under Browne,
who had been despatched (23 June) to protect the
country between London and the royalist army, served
only to increase the general discontent. "My London
regiments," he wrote (8 July), "immediately looked
on his [<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Browne's] forces as sent to relieve them,
and without expectation of further orders, are most
of them gone away; yesterday no less than 400
out of one regiment quitted their colours. On the
other side, Major-General Browne's men, being
most of them trained band men of Essex and Hertfordshire,
are so mutinous and uncommandable that
there is no hope of their stay. They are likewise
upon their march home again. Yesterday they were
like to have killed their Major-General, and they have
hurt him in the face.... I am confident that
above 2,000 Londoners ran away from their colours."<a id="noteref_652" name="noteref_652" href="#note_652"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a>
The same spirit of insubordination manifested itself
again when Waller threw himself (20 July) into
Abingdon. Most of his troops were only too anxious
to leave him, whilst the Londoners especially refused
to stir "one foot further, except it be home."<a id="noteref_653" name="noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this was not unnatural if unpatriotic. The
absence of these men from their counters and shops
portended bankruptcy to many. Even those who
stayed at home found difficulty in carrying on their
commercial pursuits, owing to the war. Credit had
been given to persons who at the outbreak of the war
threw in their lot with the king. Their estates had
thereupon been sequestrated by parliament, and the
city merchant, tradesman or craftsman was left to
recover his debt as best he could. At length (2 Aug.,
1644) the Common Council took the matter up, and
agreed to petition parliament that delinquents might
be brought to judgment, and that in all cases of
sequestration provision might be made for payment
of all just debts out of delinquents' estates.<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href="#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a> Another

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The representations made by Waller as to the
untrustworthiness of the trained bands were such as
parliament could not disregard. It resolved therefore
(12 July) to establish a permanent force amounting
in all to 10,000 foot and 3,050 horse, to be levied in
the eastern and southern counties, to take their place
and form a small standing army.<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href="#note_656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a> The city of London

reported as being ready early in August, but money
was wanted for their pay. The Common Council<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thereupon authorised the payment of £2,000 out of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More than three months had now elapsed since
parliament offered to consider any propositions that
the municipal authorities might suggest for the good
of the city. At length these were ready, and were
laid before the House on the 21st August. They
were twenty-eight in number.<a id="noteref_658" name="noteref_658" href="#note_658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a> The first six had
reference to the appointment of justices of the peace
in the city and Southwark, whilst others dealt with
the City's right to the conservancy of the Thames, the
restitution of the City's Irish estate and the extension
of its jurisdiction over the Tower. Parliament was
further urged to empower the Common Council to
correct, amend or repeal any by-law made or
procured by any company or mistery of London,
notwithstanding any statute or law to the contrary,
and generally to extend the powers of the City.
Lastly, it was proposed that, as the city had grown
very populous, the citizens should be allowed to
send two additional burgesses to parliament. The
consideration of these propositions by the Commons
was put off until October, when (25th) the House
resolved that the City should be desired to reduce the
number of propositions and to state specifically a few
of the most important and to bring forward the rest
in general terms, so that the propositions of the two
kingdoms, which had been ready for some time
past, might be forwarded to the king without more
delay.<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Common Council met accordingly on the
following day (26 Oct.) and reduced the number of
propositions to six, viz., (1) that an Act be passed
confirming to the City its charters, customs and
liberties; (2) that the militia of the city, as well as of
the parishes beyond the city, and its liberties, but
within the bills of mortality, should be regulated by
the Common Council; (3) that the Tower should be
under the government of the City; (4) that the City's
forces should not be forced to serve outside the city;
(5) that an Act might be passed confirming all by-laws
and ordinances made or to be made for calling and
regulating the Common Council of the city; and
(6) that such other propositions as should be made for
the safety and good government of the city, with the
approval of both Houses, might be confirmed by Act of
parliament. These six propositions were ordered to be
forthwith presented to parliament by the Recorder
and by alderman Pennington (as lieutenant of the
Tower), with an humble desire that they might be
sent to his majesty with the propositions of the two
kingdoms. It was hoped that the rest of the propositions
formerly presented by the City to the House
of Commons might soon pass both Houses of Parliament.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href="#note_660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the propositions which were supposed to
make for peace were under consideration, the whole
of the parliamentary forces under Essex in the west
of England, with the exception of the cavalry, had
been compelled to surrender to the royalist army.
Deserted by their leader, and left by their cavalry to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shift for themselves, the foot soldiers were driven to
accept such terms as Skippon, who still stuck to his
post, was able to obtain, and on the morning of the
2nd September they laid down their arms. News of
the disaster created great consternation in the city,
and the Common Council resolved (9 Sept.) to
petition parliament to take steps to prevent the
royalists occupying Reading as they had done before,
and to hasten the passing of a measure for raising
money for the maintenance of the fortifications and
guards of the city.<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href="#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every effort was made to prevent Charles, who
was coming up from the west, reaching the garrisons
around Oxford, where he would be able to fight to
advantage, and the City was asked (13 Sept.) to send
a contingent to assist Waller in that design. The
Common Council thereupon gave its assent (20 Sept.)
to the red and blue regiments of the trained bands
being drawn out in conjunction with three other
regiments, viz., one of the trained bands of Westminster,
one of the trained bands of Southwark, and
the auxiliaries of the Hamlets, and a week later
(27 Sept.) voted the sum of £20,000 "or thereabouts"

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These preparations were of little avail. As the

Newbury the opposing armies again tried conclusions
(27 Oct.). Notwithstanding some success which

Oxford, which he entered on the 1st November.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime better news arrived from the
north. Newcastle had at last surrendered to the Scots
(19 Oct.), and this intelligence gladdened the hearts
of the parliamentary soldiers as well as of the citizens
of London. The city might now look for a plentiful
supply of coal, a commodity which had become so
scarce that in July the civic authorities had received
permission from parliament to dig for turf and peat, by
way of a substitute for coal, wherever they thought
fit.<a id="noteref_664" name="noteref_664" href="#note_664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a> Seeing that it was by the aid of the city that a
fleet had been maintained off the north coast, that
Berwick had been secured for parliament, and that
a free passage had thus been kept open for the Scottish

justified in appealing to parliament for repayment of
the money formerly advanced by the adventurers.<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href="#note_665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a>
Notwithstanding the surrender of Newcastle the

consented to reduce it.<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href="#note_666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The close of the year (1644) found the trade
and commerce of the city in a deplorable condition.
Commercial intercourse with the woollen and linen
manufacturers of the west of England had been
almost entirely cut off, whilst the blockade of the
east coast by the royalist navy deprived the city of a
great amount of corn, fish, butter, cheese and other
provisions. The citizens were greatly opposed to free
trade being allowed with those ports and towns which
were in the hands of the royalists,<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href="#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a> but they were

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in the following year (31 Jan., 1645) a
conference was opened at Uxbridge to discuss three
propositions for peace which parliament had offered
to Charles at Oxford in November last. These propositions
involved the abolition of Episcopacy, and the
placing the entire command of the army and navy, as
well as the future conduct of the war with Ireland, in
the hands of parliament. From the outset it appeared
very unlikely that Charles would bring himself to
accept the terms thus offered. After three weeks'
discussion negotiations were broken off and the
so-called "Treaty of Uxbridge" fell to the ground.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The failure of the negotiations at Uxbridge
hastened the passing of an ordinance for re-modelling
the army and placing it on such a footing that the
men should be in receipt of constant pay and the
officers selected for military efficiency alone. Ever
since November the "New Model" ordinance—as it
was called—had been under consideration. In January
it passed the Commons, but the Lords hesitated
until the difference of opinion that had manifested
itself at Uxbridge induced them to give their assent
(15 Feb.). On the 4th March a deputation from both
Houses came into the city and informed the Common
Council that, the Treaty of Uxbridge having fallen
through, the Houses had resolved "to put their forces
into the best posture they can for the vigorous
prosecution of the war, as the best means now left
(under God) for the obtaining of peace." Parliament
had passed an ordinance—they proceeded to say—for
raising £50,000 a month for nine months for
payment of an army under Sir Thomas Fairfax, and
they now asked the City to advance a sum of £80,000
on the security of the money so to be raised in the
last five months out of the nine. The matter was
referred to a committee to carry out.<a id="noteref_669" name="noteref_669" href="#note_669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a></p>

the original purport of which was to exclude all
members of either House from commands in the
army, but was afterwards so far modified as to
compel existing officers to resign their appointments,
leaving it to parliament to re-appoint them if it would.
Essex, Waller and Manchester resigned, but when
the time came for Cromwell, the prime mover in the
re-organisation of the army, to follow suit, he and two
or three others were re-appointed to commands in the
new army. The immediate effect of the passing of this
ordinance upon the city of London was that Pennington,
who had been appointed by parliament lieutenant
of the Tower, had to resign his post. The nomination
of his successor was, however, left with the Common
Council, who sent up the name of Colonel Francis
West for the approval of the Commons (24 April).<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href="#note_671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the army was undergoing a process of
reformation outside London, considerable activity prevailed
within the city with the object of strengthening
its position. The Committee of Militia was instructed
to raise a sufficient number of men to guard the city
forts so that the trained bands might be free for more
active duties. Large sums of money were voted to
pay arrears due to gunners, "mattrosses" and workmen
who had been engaged in erecting the fortifications.
The sum of £500 was ordered to be laid out in the
purchase of gunpowder. The scout-master for the city
was encouraged in his duty of bringing information of
movements of the royalist army by the payment of
arrears due to him, and steps were taken to bring up
the regiments of the city auxiliaries to their full
complement by enlistments from the several wards.<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href="#note_672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first serious undertaking confided to Fairfax
and the New Model army was the siege of Oxford.
The utter uselessness of such an enterprise, whilst
Charles was free to roam the country and deal blows
wherever opportunity offered, failed to make itself
apparent to the Committee of Both Kingdoms, which
still governed the movements of the parliamentary
army. The siege being resolved upon, a deputation
from both Houses waited on the Common Council

to set out under Major-General Browne to join
Fairfax and Cromwell in the undertaking.<a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673" href="#note_673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a> Four days
later (20 May), when another deputation attended,
the court instructed the committee of arrears sitting
at Weavers' Hall to raise £10,000 for the purpose.<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674" href="#note_674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">674</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the main force of the parliamentary army
was wasting time in besieging Oxford, care was taken
to keep the country open round Taunton, recently set
free by a detachment sent by Fairfax. For this
purpose Massey, the governor of Gloucester, was
ordered to quit his post and march towards Bristol.<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675" href="#note_675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a>
The prospect of losing their governor, who had
achieved so many military successes in the neighbourhood,
threw the inhabitants of Gloucester into terrible
consternation, and they went so far as to petition
parliament against his removal; but somehow or
other their petition failed to be read before the
Commons. In their distress they caused their mayor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to address a letter to the city of London (29 May)
stating the facts of the case, and praying that the
Londoners, who had already done so much to save
them from the hand of the enemy, would interpose with
the Commons on their behalf, so that Colonel Massey
might be allowed to remain. The civic authorities
agreed (7 June) to lay the matter before parliament;<a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676" href="#note_676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a>
but in spite of all representations Massey had to go.
The Londoners themselves were asked (9 June) to
furnish 500 mounted musketeers for Massey's expedition,
and were encouraged to do so by "motives"
setting forth the gallant behaviour of the brigade in
and about Taunton, and the critical condition it was
in by being cut off from provisions. The Common
Council ordered the motives to be printed and circulated,
with the result that sufficient money was
raised to fit out 500 dragoons.<a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677" href="#note_677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">677</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime considerable dissatisfaction
manifested itself in the city at the state of affairs in
general, and more particularly with the manner in
which the movements of Fairfax and the New Model
army were hampered by orders from home. A
petition from divers inhabitants of the city with
certain suggestions was laid before the Common
Council for presentation to parliament. It was not
customary, however, for the Common Council to present
petitions to parliament unless drawn up by themselves,
but as the feelings of the court were in
sympathy with the petitioners it ordered two petitions
to be drawn up embracing the substance of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
original petition, and these were presented, one to
each of the Houses. After setting forth what they
esteemed to be the reasons for the ill success of the
parliamentary cause, the petitioners made known their
own wishes. In the first place, they desired that the
army of Fairfax should be recruited, and that the general
might be allowed greater freedom of action. Secondly,
that steps should be taken, before it was too late, to
recover Leicester, which had recently (31 May) fallen
into the king's hands. Thirdly, that the Scots should
be urged to march southward. Fourthly, that Cromwell
should be placed in command of the Eastern
Association. Fifthly, that adequate convoys should
be provided for merchants; and lastly, that parliament
should publish its own account of the recent
negotiations, as well as its resolutions against free
trade by sea to such ports as were in the king's
hands.<a id="noteref_678" name="noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a> The petition, which was presented by Alderman

received by both Houses, and the City thanked
for its care.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the wishes expressed in the City's petition
was soon realised, for within a week Cromwell was
appointed, not to the command of the Eastern
Association as suggested, but to a still greater command,
viz., the lieutenant-generalship of the army, an
office which, by long prescription, carried also the
command of the cavalry, an arm of the service in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which Cromwell had especially shown himself a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fairfax, being now allowed a free hand, abandoned
the siege of Oxford and set off in pursuit of the royal
army. He came up with them at Naseby, where on
the 14th June he succeeded, with the help of Cromwell
and his cavalry, in obtaining a signal victory and
utterly crushing the power of Charles in the field.
Among the wounded on the parliamentary side was
the City's old friend Skippon, "shot under the arme
six inches into his flesh." The pain of having his
wound dressed caused him to groan. "Though I
groane, I grumble not," said he to the by-standers,
and asked for a chaplain to come and pray for him.<a id="noteref_681" name="noteref_681" href="#note_681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The victory at Naseby was celebrated in the city
by a thanksgiving service at Christ Church, Newgate
(19 June), which was attended by the members of
both Houses, followed by an entertainment at Grocers'
Hall. The hall not being large enough to contain the
whole of the company, the members of the Common
Council dined by themselves at the hall of the Mercers
Company. Nothing was omitted that could serve to
enhance the reputation of the City.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wishes of the citizens were to be further
gratified. The Scottish army was about to move
southward, and parliament had voted a month's pay,
or £31,000. The City was asked to assist in raising<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the money (14 June). To this the Common Council
readily agreed, but at the same time directed the
Recorder to represent to parliament that the citizens
were anxious for the Scots to recover Leicester as
speedily as possible.<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href="#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a> Before the army had time to

surrendered to Fairfax (18 June).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In July the City was called upon to assist in
raising 1,000 horse and 500 dragoons for the relief of
the counties of Oxford, Buckingham, Berkshire and
others, and the better security of the Association.<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a>
Three months later (2 Sept.) another contingent of
500 light horse and a like number of "dragoneers" were
required "to pursue the forces of the king." Each
member of the Common Council was directed to provide
a light horse and arms or to pay the sum of £12
in lieu thereof. A dragoon horse and arms might be
compounded for by payment of half that sum.
Parliament agreed to charge the excise with the
sum of £16,000 to provide compensation for any
loss the contributors might sustain, whilst the City
contributed out of its Chamber the sum of £400
towards the pay of officers, the buying of trophies and
other necessaries.<a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685" href="#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aid of the City was now invoked by
Plymouth as formerly it had been by Gloucester.
On the 5th September the mayor and aldermen of
Plymouth addressed a letter to the mayor and
common council of London enclosing a petition they<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were about to lay before parliament. The petition set
forth how, in the absence of Fairfax, who was laying
siege to Bristol, the whole country round Plymouth
was in the hands of the enemy; and an attack would,
it was feared, be soon made by Lord Goring on the
town garrison. Unless the siege was raised before
winter, or considerable supplies brought in, the town
would be unable to hold out longer. This petition
the municipal authorities of London were asked to
second, with the hope of prevailing upon parliament
to send at least that relief which had been so often
desired and so often promised. A whole fortnight
elapsed before the letter and petition were brought to
the notice of the Common Council (20 Sept.)—the
letter from Gloucester had taken a week in transit,
such was the state of the country—and then it was
resolved to send a deputation from the city, including
the two sheriffs, to express to the Committee of Both
Kingdoms the desire of the City that they would be
pleased to take the petition into speedy and serious
consideration, and to provide for the safety and
defence of Plymouth.<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href="#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Londoners themselves were suffering from
an inconvenience from which they had hitherto in
vain sought relief from parliament, and that was the
large number of royalist soldiers—amounting to no
less than 3,000—which after the battle of Naseby
had been quartered on the city.<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href="#note_687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> Now that the war
was practically over, so far as the king was concerned,
the Common Council again took the matter in hand,
and it was suggested that the Convocation House and
its cloisters situate on the south side of St. Paul's<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Churchyard should be fitted up at a cost of £40 for
their reception. By this means Bethlehem hospital,
where many of the prisoners had been housed, would
be free to minister again to the wants of the poor.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The troubles with Charles had scarcely terminated
before a new struggle commenced. A monster had
been raised, after much hesitation and with no little
difficulty, in the shape of a well-organised and regularly
paid army, the command of which was virtually in
the hands of a small political party known as
Independents. The great fear was lest this party,
with the army at its back, should over-ride the wishes
of the Presbyterians, a party which was numerically
stronger than the Independents, both in the House
and in the country; and to avoid such a catastrophe
the Presbyterians of England were ready to join hands
with their brethren in Scotland.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">The Presbyterians and the Scottish army.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The House, however, was unfortunate enough at
this critical juncture to offend the Scots as well as the
citizens of London. The Scottish army had been
invited to march southward to attack Newark, whither
Charles had betaken himself after witnessing from the
walls of Chester the defeat of his troops on Rowton
Heath (24 Sept.), and the Commons had promised to
raise a sum of £30,000 for its pay provided it arrived
before Newark by the 1st day of November.<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a> This
sum the City promised to find (10 Oct.), but only on

offended the dignity of the Scots by a series of resolutions
protesting against the conduct of the Scottish<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
army in not attacking the enemy as well as in levying
money on the inhabitants of the northern counties,
and demanded the removal of the garrisons which had
been placed in Newcastle, Carlisle and other towns
without the consent of parliament.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The quarrel between parliament and the City
was scarcely less serious, and arose out of an attempt
to foist a system of Presbyterianism upon the citizens
which should serve as a model for the rest of the
kingdom. It was not that the Londoner objected
to the principle of Presbyterianism; the natural bent
of his mind was in that direction, and the City had
already petitioned parliament for the election of
elders to join with the parish ministers.<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a> What he
found fault with was the mode of electing the elders
prescribed by parliament (23 Sept.).<a id="noteref_693" name="noteref_693" href="#note_693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a> The scheme was
so far from satisfying the general body of citizens that
a number of them presented a petition to the Common
Council to address both Houses of Parliament, with a
view to having the powers of the elders sufficiently
enlarged to effect a genuine reform in the Church.<a id="noteref_694" name="noteref_694" href="#note_694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a> They
wanted, in fact, to see parliamentary control over the
Church in matters purely ecclesiastical withdrawn.
Herein they were supported by the ministers of their
own parish churches, who drew up a list of reforms
they desired to see executed and the reasons why
they so desired.<a id="noteref_695" name="noteref_695" href="#note_695"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a> It was a difficult matter on which
to approach parliament. Nevertheless, in accordance
with a resolution of the Common Council (18 Nov.),<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a deputation of aldermen and common councillors,
of whom Alderman Gibbs acted as spokesman,
presented themselves (19 Nov.) before the House of
Commons with the petition of the citizens, as well as
with the "desires and reasons" of the city clergy.
The reply they got was far from encouraging. They
were given to understand that parliament was well
aware of its trust and duty, and was quite able to
discharge both, if only it was let alone, and its purpose
not misconceived and prejudged as it appeared to
have been in the city; and they were dismissed with
the caution not to form premature opinions about
matters which were still under discussion.<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href="#note_696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">696</span></span></a> Notwithstanding
this rebuff, the deputation the following day
attended before the Lords (20 Nov.), who returned
them a far more gracious and sympathetic answer.
After thanking the deputation for their expressions of
submission to the resolutions of parliament, their
lordships assured them that none should excel them
in their endeavours for the maintenance of the
covenant, the advancement and settling of God's
true religion, and the discharge of the trust reposed
in them.<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime a deputation from parliament
had waited on the Common Council (12 Nov.) with a
request for a loan of £6,000 for the troops engaged
in blockading Chester. The court agreed to the
request, but thought it high time to learn precisely
how the city stood with respect to loans already made
to parliament, and appointed (17 Nov.) a committee
to report on the whole matter, with a view of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
addressing parliament for re-payment of monies in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was feared that the Scottish army might
change sides. It wanted supplies. The City, we have
seen, had agreed with parliament to advance a sum
of £30,000 for payment of the Scots, provided their
army appeared before Newark by the 1st November.
This condition had not been fulfilled. The army,
nevertheless, appeared later on, and a committee of the
House of Commons came down to the city and asked
the citizens (6 Dec.) to stand by their former promise
and advance the sum mentioned, which they readily
consented to do.<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href="#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question with Charles was, from whom was
he likely to obtain the better terms, the English or the
Scots? On the 26th December he addressed a letter
to the Speaker of the House of Lords, asking whether
the two Houses of Parliament, the Scottish commissioners,
the municipal authorities, as well as the
militia of the city and the officers of both armies,
would guarantee his personal security if he came to
reside in London or Westminster, with a retinue not
exceeding three hundred in number, for a period of
forty days.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href="#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a> The risk of allowing such a step was too
great. Already the Earl of Holland had been heard
to threaten a royalist rising in the city if only
Charles could be brought in safety to Westminster.
Not getting a reply so quickly as he wished, Charles
wrote again three days later (29 Dec.) urging his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
former proposal.<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a> More delay took place, during

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day following the despatch of this reply was
kept in the city as a day of solemn humiliation.
Sermons were preached before the mayor, aldermen
and members of the common council, who afterwards
individually took the oath and covenant. An enquiry
was subsequently ordered (9 Feb.) for the purpose of
discovering what members of the common council
had failed to take the covenant on this occasion, and
the reasons why they had not done so. A few

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 15th January Charles made overtures to
parliament for the first time on the question of
religion. He was prepared to allow religion to be
settled as it was in the reign of Elizabeth and James,
"with full liberty for the ease of their consciences
who will not communicate in that service established
by law, and likewise for the free and public use of
the directory prescribed and, by command of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This important concession on the part of Charles—a
concession which only the necessities of the time
induced him, after much exercise of mind, to make—was
announced to parliament on the same day that
the City presented a petition<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> against toleration of any
other form of religion than the Presbyterianism
already adopted by parliament and the citizens. The
petitioners declared that since they last addressed
the Houses on the subject of religion a fresh election
of the Common Council had taken place, and the
inhabitants of many of the wards had taken the
opportunity of asking their alderman that parliament
might be again desired to settle Church
government and forbid toleration. Private meetings
for religious worship, they went on to say, were
constantly held. In one parish there were at least
eleven. Orthodox ministers were evil spoken of, as
if the city were still under the "tyranny of prelatical
government." Women had taken to preaching, and
such blasphemies were uttered as made the petitioners
tremble to think of. Having heard that it was the
intention of divers persons to petition the House for
a toleration of such doctrines as were against the
covenant under pretext of liberty of conscience, the
petitioners humbly prayed that parliament would
take steps to remedy abuses and to settle the Church
government according to the solemn covenant made
with the most high God. The Commons lent a ready
ear to the petition and thanked the City for their
display of piety and religion. It was gratifying to
them to know that they had the sympathy of the
City in their anxiety to settle the peace of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst endeavouring to come to terms with
parliament Charles was also in communication both
with the Scots and the Independents. His purpose
was to play one party off against the other. A
complete understanding existed between the citizens
and the Scots on the subject of religion. On the
11th February the Scottish commissioners themselves
appeared at a Common Council bearing a letter from
the president of the Scottish parliament addressed to
the lord mayor, aldermen and common council of
the city, thanking them for their zeal for the
reformation of religion and uniformity of Church
government, as well as for the large sums of money
advanced to the armies in defence of religion and the
liberty of the subject.<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a> The Common Council thanked
the commissioners for the favour thus shown, and
begged them to assure their countrymen that the City
would continue its zeal and affection for the reformation
of religion and uniformity of Church government, and
would persevere in its resolution to preserve the same
according to the covenant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as Parliament heard that the City had

sent a deputation to learn all the particulars and to

Council that there was "no jealousie at all or dislike
of their proceedings" in the business. In the meanwhile
the House called upon Francis Allen, a member
of the House as well as a member of the Common
Council, to give an account of what had taken place
in the city on the 11th. This he did to the best of his
ability, giving from memory the substance of the letter
from Scotland. He then proceeded to say that one
of the Scottish commissioners, Lord Lauderdale, had
made the following remark before the Common
Council, viz., "That many aspersions had been caste
upon their armie and their proceedings by malignants;
and desired that the authors of them might be
looked upon as those that endeavour to disturb the
unitie of both kingdomes."<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href="#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That at least was the story as recorded in the
Journal of the House. Allen, however, declared that
he had been inaccurately recorded, and the Common
Council, in giving parliament their own version of the
matter, denied that Lauderdale had made any such
remark. He had said nothing that could give offence.
They forwarded the letter as desired, but begged that
it might be returned in order that it might be entered
on the city's Journal. They further expressed a wish
to print and publish it so that the real facts might be
known. Allen, they said, was not to be credited, and
had been guilty of a breach of privilege in what he
had done.<a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href="#note_711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">711</span></span></a></p>

declared (5 Dec, 1649) that it deemed it "an acceptable

(19 Dec.) to revoke all votes of the court that had

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto the City and Parliament had, in the
presence of a common danger, mutually supported one
another; but as soon as the royalists ceased to give
further cause for alarm differences immediately sprang
up. The question of the City's jurisdiction over the
militia raised within the weekly bills of mortality, as
well as over that raised within the city and liberties,
was no new question. It had been raised at least
as far back as August, 1644,<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> but during the crisis of
the civil war the matter had been allowed to drop
until December, 1645, when the City again brought it
forward and urged parliament to acknowledge its
jurisdiction.<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> Before parliament would give its assent
it wished to be informed whether the jurisdiction
claimed by the City was already vested in the City
by Charles or by custom, and if not, what extension of
jurisdiction was it that the City now desired?<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a> The<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chief opposition came from the inhabitants of Middlesex,
Surrey, Southwark and Westminster, who
objected to their militia being placed under the
command of the mayor, aldermen and common
council of the city. All parties were cited to
appear before the Star Chamber on the 31st June,
1646, to support their own contention.<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href="#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a> Parliament
had already (27 Jan.) expressed itself as willing to
sanction the government of the militia of the city
and liberties being vested in the municipal authorities
and to allow that the city forces should not be called
upon to serve away from the city without their own
consent,<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> but this was not enough. What the City
desired was nothing more and nothing less than what
had already been proposed to the king at Oxford
with the sanction of both Houses, namely, "the
government of the militia of the parishes without
London and the liberties within the weekly bills
of mortality." Parliament had made no scruple
about the matter at a time when it stood in sore need
of assistance from the City; and the City did not
intend to let it go back lightly on its word.<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href="#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A petition was accordingly presented to the
House of Commons by alderman Fowke on the 6th
February.<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href="#note_720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a> The petition set out at considerable length
all the proceedings that had taken place since the
question of the militia was first submitted to Charles.
It compared the attitude of the city towards parliament
in the late civil war with the part played by the
citizens in a previous civil war, viz., the war of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Barons, when (according to the petitioners) the
Barons were eventually beaten out of the field owing
to the citizens of London staying at home! The
petitioners proceeded to show the necessity of the
City being empowered to raise militia in the adjacent
counties for the purpose of keeping open a passage
for victualling the city in times of danger; that
since the militia of the suburbs had been under the
command of the City good service had been rendered
to the parliamentary cause, and notably in the relief
of Gloucester; that if it were now removed from the
jurisdiction of the City the suburban forts might be
seized and both the city and parliament might be
threatened; and that it was for the better preservation
of parliament, and not for the purpose of rendering
the city militia independent of parliament, that the
petitioners appeared before the House. Finally,
Alderman Fowke, who acted as spokesman, declared
himself authorised to state that if the militia of the
city and kingdom were not settled by the king and
parliament there would be no course left open to the
city authorities but to act according to their conscience
and to abide by their covenant. A similar petition
was presented to the House of Lords (7 Feb.). A
week later (14 Feb.) a counter-petition was addressed
to the Commons by the inhabitants of the Tower
Hamlets, Westminster and Southwark,<a id="noteref_721" name="noteref_721" href="#note_721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">721</span></span></a> and on the
13th March a committee was appointed to arrange, if
possible, a compromise.<a id="noteref_722" name="noteref_722" href="#note_722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">722</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before this question was settled another had
arisen to widen the breach between parliament and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the city in the shape of an ordinance for establishing

One clause of this ordinance—clause 14—was particularly
objectionable as introducing the authority of
the State into matters of Church government. Commissioners
were to be appointed, of whom nothing
was known, to regulate the Church in each province.
The Common Council, being urged by inhabitants of
the city to oppose a measure so opposed to the Word
of God,<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href="#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a> presented petitions to both Houses (to the
Lords first, they having not yet assented to clause 14)
praying that no officers might be appointed to exercise
any Church censures contrary to the Scriptures, and
that their appointment might be in accordance with
the Word of God.<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href="#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> The petitions were so badly
received by both Houses that the municipal authorities
took fright, and asked that they might be withdrawn
and expunged from the Journals of Parliament. Their
request was acceded to, but only on condition that the
petitions were likewise expunged from the City's
Records.<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reconciliation between parliament and the
city was followed by an interchange of courtesies.
The royalist army under Hopton had recently
surrendered to Fairfax in the west of England
(14 March), and had been disbanded; and the last
hope of Charles had vanished in the defeat of Astley's
troops after a sharp engagement at Stow-on-the-Wold
(22 March). "You have now done your work" were
the parting words of the veteran commander to his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
soldiers, "and may go play, unless you will fall out

from both Houses waited on the Common Council,
and invited the mayor, aldermen and council, as "the
representative body of the city," to attend a public
thanksgiving service to be held that day week (2 April)
at Christ Church, Newgate Street. The invitation was
graciously accepted, and the City returned the compliment
by asking both Houses to dine the same
day at Grocers' Hall.<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 19th May, whilst virtually a prisoner in
the hands of the Scots, Charles wrote to the City<a id="noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a>
declaring his readiness to concur in settling truth and
peace, his desire to have all things speedily concluded
to that end, and his hope that his return to his ancient
city might be to the satisfaction of parliament and his
people. The Commons were angry with the civic
authorities for opening the king's letter without their
leave, and returned a curt answer to a remonstrance
presented to them by the City calling upon them to
suppress heresy, to unite with the Scots and to come
to a speedy arrangement with the king.<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> The Lords,
to whom a similar remonstrance had been presented,
expressed themselves more graciously. They acknowledged
the fidelity and constant services of the City to
parliament. They were satisfied with the resolutions
of the citizens to settle the Protestant religion and to
preserve the rights and privileges of parliament, the
liberties of the kingdoms and the person and authority<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his majesty. As for their lord mayor (Thomas
Adams), whose character the petitioners had declared
to have been aspersed by certain members of the
Commons (for opening the king's letter without
leave?), they (the Lords) held him in high esteem,
and declared that nothing had been said or done in
their House to his prejudice. As soon as they should
be informed of the nature of his grievance they would
be found ready in a parliamentary way to do him
right.<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> The Common Council received a formal
address of thanks for presenting this remonstrance
from a large body of "citizens of the best rank and
qualitie," as well as from the General Assembly of
Scotland.<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand an attempt was made to
minimise the effect of the remonstrance by getting up
a counter-petition on the pretext that the remonstrance
had not fairly represented the wishes of the majority
of the citizens. This counter-petition, which is said to
have been backed up with 5,000 or 6,000 signatures,
was duly presented to the Commons, who by a small
majority passed a vote of thanks to the petitioners
(2 June).<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile the king's letter of the 19th May
remained unanswered. At last, on the 3rd July, an
answer—or "petition"—was drafted and submitted
to the Common Council for approval. After acknowledging
the special favour of receiving a letter direct
from the king, the citizens expressed their desire to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
assure his majesty and the whole world of the
continuance of their loyalty in accordance with the
terms of their protestation and covenant. They
prayed him to comply with the propositions for the
settlement of religion and peace and the maintenance
of the union of the two nations which parliament was
about to send him, and they expressed an earnest
hope to see him return to his ancient city with honour
and joy.<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city fathers were too wary to despatch their
petition without first obtaining leave from parliament.
On the following day (4 July), therefore, a deputation of
aldermen and members of the council, with Alderman
Sir Thomas Foote at its head, presented itself before
the House of Lords to ask their leave to despatch the
City's answer to the king. After perusing the petition
the Lords declared their approval of its being sent to
the king, and courteously acknowledged the action of

who again returned a churlish reply. The deputation
was given to understand that the House had been
put to some inconvenience in giving them an audience,
being busily engaged at the time in pressing business.
The petition, however, was of importance, and would
receive their consideration at a convenient time.<a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Friday the 10th the Commons were pressed
for an answer, but they again put the matter off on
the plea of pressure of business. The next day the
deputation again waited on the House, attended by<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the city members of parliament, and about four
o'clock in the afternoon received a message from the
Commons that the City's petition was not to be
forwarded to the king, and that "in convenient time"
they would send and inform the Common Council of
their further pleasure. Accordingly two of the city's
members, Sir Thomas Soame and Samuel Vassall,
appeared before the council on the 15th, when
Vassall declared that he had been commanded by
the House to make an explanation. In order to avoid
mistakes he would read the message he was to deliver.
The message was to the effect that inasmuch as
the propositions which had been despatched to the
king by parliament on the 13th June embraced the
city of London as well as the whole kingdom, the
House could not approve of the city's petition being
forwarded to his majesty. Being desired by the
council to leave the paper with them, Vassall declared
that he had no authority to do so.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href="#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a> In the meantime,
the House had appointed a committee to
enquire "concerning the first principal contrivers and
framers of the city remonstrance, and concerning
such as have or do labour to disaffect the people and
the city from the parliament";<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href="#note_738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> but before the committee
could take steps to carry out its instructions,
circumstances had arisen which made it advisable
to let the matter drop and not to widen the breach
between the city and parliament.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 30th July the parliamentary commissioners
arrived in Newcastle for the purpose of laying before
Charles propositions for peace. Charles had already<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
become possessed of a copy, and had long since
made up his mind to reject them. The commissioners
had received positive orders to allow the king ten
days to give his assent, and if he failed to give his
assent within that time after their arrival they were
at once to return.<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> The only reply which Charles
condescended to give was contained in a letter which
he handed to the commissioners on the 1st August.
The letter was read before the House on the 12th.
It contained little more than vague promises and a
request that he might be allowed to come to London
to discuss the propositions at length.<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same day that the king's answer was read
before the Lords a letter from the Scottish commissioners
was produced, in which they offered to
withdraw their forces from England upon payment of
expenses already incurred.<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> After a considerable

It only remained for parliament to raise the sum of
£200,000 needed for the first payment, and to whom
was it more natural that application should first be
made than to the City? A large deputation from
the Commons, including Cromwell himself, accordingly
waited on the Common Council (7 Sept.) to
ask it to consider ways and means for raising the
money. The committee to whom the matter was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
referred lost no time. On the 9th it reported to
the court a scheme for raising the money on the
security of the excise and sale of the Bishops' lands,
the security to extend to previous loans. Parliament
accepted these terms, on the understanding that
"Bishops' lands" were not to comprise impropriations
and advowsons.<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a></p>

army, the suppression of heresy, the union of the two
kingdoms, the free election of members of parliament,
and the City's government of its own militia. As for
the "bringing home of his majesty," that was left to
the wisdom of both Houses, with the confidence that
they would preserve his majesty's royal person and

The City petitioned both Houses that it might be
disbanded, and that the Common Council might have
authority to make annual election of the members of
the city's militia. To those petitions gracious answers
were returned, the Lords declaring that they had
considered already a measure touching the city's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The army would in all probability have been
disbanded in due course, and all might have gone well
but for the high-handed treatment it received from
the Commons. It was proposed to ask the soldiers
after disbandment to volunteer for service in Ireland.
There were, however, considerable arrears of pay due
to them, and neither officers nor men would volunteer
until they had received some assurance from parliament
that they would be paid all that was due to
them. Instead of doing this parliament contented
itself with voting a sum of £200,000, not for satisfying
arrears of pay, but "for the service of England and
Ireland."<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> The soldiers were about to petition

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was easier for parliament to vote a sum of
£200,000 than to raise that amount. Application was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as usual made to the City (6 April).<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href="#note_751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a> The zeal of the

passing the ordinance sent down to them by the

the following day (17 April) the Common Council
was prepared with a scheme to be submitted to
parliament for raising the money. Like other schemes
that had gone before, it proposed that subscribers to
certain former loans should add arrears of interest,
and by making a further advance equivalent to the
sum total should have the whole secured on the sale
of lands of bishops and delinquents.<a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href="#note_753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a> Parliament
hesitated at first to allow the lands of delinquents and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The appointment of the new militia committee
was made a solemn business by the citizens. Tuesday,
the 27th April, was fixed for the nomination, which
was preceded by prayer and a sermon in the church
of St. Laurence Jewry, and a formal renewal of the
covenant by all present. Thirty-one persons, the
number prescribed by the ordinance, were nominated,
all of them Presbyterians. Of these seven were
aldermen. On the 4th May both Houses signified
their approval of the city's nominees, and ordained
that any nine of them, whereof three were to be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
aldermen and six to be commoners, should thenceforth
constitute a committee for the militia to order and
direct the same according to the true meaning and
intent of the ordinance recently passed.<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755" href="#note_755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the first acts of the new committee was
to ask leave of parliament to raise an additional sum
of £20,000 to satisfy the arrears due to the city's
forces that had been engaged in guarding the Houses
of Parliament, the Tower and forts within the lines of
communication around the city. Parliament only
consented, however, to the sum of £12,000 being
raised for this purpose.<a id="noteref_756" name="noteref_756" href="#note_756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">756</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The re-modelling of the city force to the exclusion
of everyone tainted with independency only served
to increase the discontent of the army. It was bad
enough to find the Presbyterians in parliament
joining hands with the Presbyterians in the city
against the army; it was worse if the city trained
bands were to receive their arrears of pay whilst the
army was left out in the cold. An attempt was made
to bring pressure to bear on parliament by a mob of
reformadoes or disbanded soldiers besetting the House
of Commons on the 7th June. These men clamoured
for their arrears of pay and refused to go away unless
the sum of £10,000 should be voted for them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the following day (8 June) the City presented
another petition to parliament praying that the army
might be paid off as speedily as possible; that the
king, who had recently been carried off from Holmby
House by a troop of cavalry under Joyce, might be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disposed of in such a way as to allow the parliaments
of England and Scotland free access to him; and thirdly
that, seeing the danger of the times, an ordinance of
the 17th January, 1645, authorising the City to raise
cavalry in their own defence and to apprehend disaffected
persons, might be revived. The House,
which was guarded at the time by a city regiment,
could scarcely do otherwise than comply with the
prayer of the petitioners.<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href="#note_757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three days later (11 June) a letter was brought
to the city by "two messengers that looked like
soldiers," signed by Fairfax and twelve others,
informing the civic authorities of the army's approach
to London.<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a> The City was asked to believe that such
action on the part of the army was only directed
against those who were endeavouring to engage
the kingdom in a new war. As Englishmen, if not
as soldiers, the writers desired only "the peace
of the kingdom and liberty of the subject, according
to the votes and declarations of parliament."
They desired no alteration of the civil government,
nor to hinder Presbyterianism. When once
the State had settled a matter there was nothing for it
but to submit or suffer; they only wished that every
good citizen and every peaceful man might be allowed
to enjoy liberty. "These, in brief," continued the
writers, "are our desires, and the things for which we
stand, beyond which we shall not go; and for obtaining
these things we are drawing near your city,
professing sincerely from our hearts we intend not<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
evil toward you; declaring with all confidence and
assurance that if you appear not against us in these
our just desires to assist that wicked party that
would embroil us and the kingdom, nor we nor our
soldiers shall give you the least offence." It was
true, they went on to say, that a rich city like London
offered a tempting bait for poor hungry soldiers, but
the officers would protect it with their last drop of
blood from the soldiery provided no provocation were
offered by the citizens themselves. Their men valued
their own high character above any wealth, and the
citizens would act like fellow subjects and brethren by
using their influence with parliament on their behalf.
On the other hand, "if after all this you, or a considerable
part of you, be seduced to take up arms in
opposition to or hindrance of these our just undertakings,
we hope by this brotherly premonition, to
the sincerity thereof we call God to witness, we have
freed ourselves from all that ruin which may befall
that great and populous city, having thereby washed
our hands thereof."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This letter was laid before the House with a
request that it would endeavour to prevent Fairfax
quartering his army on the city, thereby enhancing
the price of provisions, and this request was acceded
to. At the same time a new committee of safety,
composed of members of both Houses, was appointed

own, and this was despatched to the army on the
12th, after receiving the approval of the House. In
it the City disavowed any animosity towards the
army. The citizens had only put themselves into a
state of defence against unlawful violence. So far
were they from opposing the just demands of the
army, they had themselves presented a humble
address to parliament that these might be granted.
If the officers would only keep the army at a
distance of thirty miles from London, and so give
no occasion for disorder or rise in the price of
victuals in the city, it would go far to prove the
sincerity of the intentions expressed in their letter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This letter found the army at St. Albans. The

"council of war" declared the utter impossibility of
removing the army to a distance of thirty miles from
London so long as enlistments were being made in
the city and suburbs in addition to the usual trained
bands and auxiliaries. A stop must be put to this,
otherwise the army would have to take the matter in
hand. In the second the officers informed the civic
authorities that the movements of the army would
greatly depend upon the action parliament took<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with respect to certain "papers" now to be submitted

of the army to speak in the name of the English
people, and demanded the banishment from office of
all who spoke ill of it. To this was added a further
demand, viz., the expulsion from the House of those
who had proved themselves unworthy of their seats.
This last demand was followed by a formal charge
laid in the name of the army against eleven members
of the House of Commons (of whom Glyn, the city's
Recorder, was one) of having prejudiced the liberties
of the subject, misrepresented the army and raised
forces for a new war.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As matters turned out the army had little cause
to fear the enlistments that had taken place in the
city. An attempt had, it is true, been made to
increase the number of the militia, but it had met
with poor success. When it became known in the
city that the army was moving southward from
Royston something like a panic prevailed. The
trained bands were called out on pain of death and
shops ordered to be shut, Sir John Gayer, the lord
mayor, being especially active. But when the companies

lamentably deficient in numbers, "not ten men of

as a farce by the on-lookers, who jeered at the troops
as they passed; and those who had shut up their
shops at the mayor's command soon opened them
again. It was clear that the citizens had no intention
of being engaged in a "new war." Parliament, finding
this to be the case, annulled the order for enlistments
and resolved that "the city might upon occasion send
letters to the army, so as they did first present them
to the House for their approbation."<a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the 18th June the City was ready with its
reply to the last letters of Fairfax and the council of
war. This reply had after some hesitation received
the sanction of the Commons, and the City was to be
thenceforth permitted to correspond with the army
on its own responsibility, and without submitting its
letters first to parliament.<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href="#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a> It entirely disavowed any
privity or consent of the Common Council in connection
with the recent enlistments other than those
of the trained bands and auxiliaries. All such enlistments
Fairfax was assured had now been stopped,
the civic authorities having intervened as requested.
The City's readiness to conform to the wishes of the
army would, it was hoped, draw forth a fuller assurance
that the army intended no prejudice either to parliament
or to the city, which had expended so much<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
blood and treasure in its defence, and that it would
remove its quarters farther from London.<a id="noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href="#note_766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This reply did not give unqualified satisfaction.
It was impossible, wrote Fairfax and the council of
war (21 June),<a id="noteref_767" name="noteref_767" href="#note_767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a> to remove the army farther from

of the House of Commons. That the City had done
its part in stopping enlistments they readily acknowledged,
but information had reached them of underhand
workings still going on to enlist men, as a "foundation
for a new armie and a new warre." The letter concluded
with a reiteration of the writers' intention to
do nothing prejudicial to the parliament or the city,
for which they professed "a most tender regard." To
this letter a postscript was added the following day
(22 June) to the effect that since writing the above
they had heard that parliament had been again
threatened by a mob of reformadoes. It was therefore
more necessary than ever to preserve the remnant
of liberty that attached to the House.</p>

desiring that some representatives of the city might
take up permanent quarters with the army until
matters became more settled. Accordingly, on the
following day (24 June) the Common Council
appointed Alderman Warner, Deputy Pack and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Colonel Player to go to Fairfax and the army and
remain with them until further orders. They were
to give his excellency and the council of war an
account of the true state of affairs respecting enlistments,
and assure them that the City would take good
care that both Houses should be allowed to conduct
their affairs in peace and quiet.<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href="#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the commissioners arrived in camp
they were informed that the army was about to
change its quarters to Uxbridge. On the 25th
Fairfax again took occasion in a letter to the City,
dated from Berkhampstead,<a id="noteref_770" name="noteref_770" href="#note_770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">770</span></span></a> to enlarge upon the
danger that was likely to arise from continued attempts
to raise forces in Wales, "besides underhand workings
in your city," and from parliament being threatened
by the presence of reformadoes. It could not
be expected that the kingdom would be safe, or
justice done, so long as the accused members sat as
judges. "We have written this to you," the letter
concluded, "for your satisfaction that so nothing may
be done without giving you a perfect account of our
intentions and ends, and still to continue our
assurance to you that should necessity bring us
nearer to the city our former faith given you shall
be observed inviolably, there being nothing more
(next the good of the kingdom) in our thoughts and
desires than the prosperity of your city." It was
six o'clock in the evening when this letter was
brought to the Common Council, so that there was
only time to acknowledge its receipt in a letter,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which was on the point of being despatched to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As far as the removal of the objectionable
members of the House went Fairfax soon had his
way. For, notwithstanding the Commons having
declared on the 25th that they saw no valid reason
for suspending the members, the members themselves
solved the difficulty on the following day by asking
leave of absence, which the House was willing enough
to grant.<a id="noteref_772" name="noteref_772" href="#note_772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">772</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bands of reformadoes which infested the
city presented a greater difficulty. On the 2nd July
the City once more addressed itself to parliament in
the form of a petition suggesting a remedy for this
grievance, and although the petition reflected strongly
upon the mismanagement of affairs by the government,
and ventured to prescribe rules for its better
regulation, it was more favourably received than
others of a far less bold character had formerly been.<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href="#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a>
The temper of the House must indeed have changed
when it could listen calmly to charges of malversation
of money collected for the disbandment of the army,
and to such advice as that parliament should "improve
its time" and busy itself only with such laws
as might settle the government of the Church, secure
the people from unlawful and arbitrary power, and
restore his majesty to his just rights and authority,
according to the covenant. A few months ago any
deputation that dared to address the House in these<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
terms would have been sharply dismissed. Times
had changed; and now, instead of a rebuke, the
City received thanks for its "constant very good
affections," and a day was appointed for taking the
petition into consideration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week later (8 July) Fairfax wrote to the City from
Reading—whither he had removed the headquarters of
the army (3 July) upon certain concessions being made
by parliament—enclosing a copy of a paper which he
had forwarded to parliament setting forth the obstacles
which still stood in the way of a peaceful settlement,
viz., the continued presence of reformadoes in and
about London, as well of the army raised for Ireland
but not despatched there, and the non-expulsion from
the House of those members who had aided the king
against parliament.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href="#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a> At length parliament gave way.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matters were not improved by the action of the
apprentices of London, who, like the rest of the
inhabitants, took sides with king or parliament.
Parliament had recently sanctioned a monthly holiday
to all apprentices. The first of these holidays fell on
Tuesday, the 13th July. Grateful for this concession,
a number of lads employed the day in presenting a
petition to the Commons calling upon them to uphold
their own authority, recall those who had been so<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unreasonably expelled, protect the clergy, and bring

royalist apprentices could stand, so the next day they
had their turn, and presented a petition to both
Houses praying for the suppression of conventicles,
the restoration of the king, the maintenance of the
covenant, and the disbandment of the army.<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href="#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a> This

demand of the council of war an immediate march
on London, a step which would most certainly have
been undertaken but for the strenuous opposition of
Cromwell and Ireton.<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week later (21 July) a mob of apprentices,
reformadoes, watermen and other disaffected persons
met at Skinners' Hall, and one and all signed a Solemn
Engagement pledging themselves to maintain the
Covenant and to procure the king's restoration to
power on the terms offered by him on the 12th May
last, viz., the abandonment of the episcopacy for
three years and the militia for ten. An endeavour
was made to enlist the support of the municipal
authorities to this engagement, but a letter from
Fairfax (23 July) soon gave them to understand that
the army looked on the matter as one "set on foot
by the malice of some desperate-minded men, this
being their last engine for the putting all into confusion
when they could not accomplish their wicked<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

joined in denouncing the Solemn Engagement of the
City, their declaration against it being ordered to be
published by beat of drum and sound of trumpet
through London and Westminster, and within the
lines of communication.<a id="noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> Anyone found subscribing

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile the army council had forwarded
(19 July) certain recommendations to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Saturday, the 24th July, the day after the
Lords had given their assent to the proposal touching
the militia, two petitions were presented to the
Common Council praying it to take steps for retaining
the militia in the hands of the city committee.<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href="#note_785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a> Both
petitions were well received by the court, and a draft
of another petition from the court itself was at once
made for presentation to both Houses on the following
Monday, together with the petitions presented to the
court. The sheriffs and the whole court, or as many<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of them as could go, with the exception of those
actually serving on the militia committee, were
ordered to carry the petitions to Westminster. When
Monday came an excited crowd of apprentices and
others followed the sheriffs and members of the
Common Council up to the very doors of the Houses.
The few Peers who were in attendance on that day
were soon brought to pass a resolution abrogating the
recent ordinance.<a id="noteref_786" name="noteref_786" href="#note_786"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">786</span></span></a> When the turn of the Commons
came they made a bolder stand. The consideration
of the petitions was frequently interrupted by cries
of "Vote! vote!" from the apprentices, who stood
at the open doorway with their hats on.<a id="noteref_787" name="noteref_787" href="#note_787"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> Hostile
as the city was, the House had no means of restoring
order without its aid. The civic authorities showed
no particular haste in complying with a request
for assistance. The Common Council assembled in
the afternoon, but all it did was to agree that the
members present should adjourn in a body to Westminster
"and use their best endeavour by all gentle
ways and means possible they can to appease the
said multitude and to free the said House from
danger."<a id="noteref_788" name="noteref_788" href="#note_788"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a> At length, towards eight o'clock in the
evening, the Commons, worn-out and exhausted,
yielded to the pressure put upon them and repealed
the obnoxious ordinance, after which the mob was content
to obey the city councillors and quietly disperse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The civic authorities having recovered its control
over the militia immediately began to put the city<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in a posture of defence. In this it was assisted by
the apprentices offering their services, their lives and
fortunes against any power whatsoever that should
attack the city. The Common Council thanked
them for their good will, and desired them to
carry themselves in an orderly and regular way,
and endeavour to prevent disorder and tumult.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a>
There were already rumours that the army had
broken up and was marching towards London. No
time was to be lost if the city was to be saved from
falling into its hands. The militia committee was
ordered to draw up a declaration in justification of all
that the civic authorities had done, whilst a letter
was sent (28 July) to Fairfax deprecating any attempt
by the army to "intermeddle" with the liberties or
privileges of the city or to interpose in the matter of
the militia, which should be used only in defence of
parliament and the city without giving occasion for
offence to anyone. He was assured that now the
government of the militia had become revested in the
city there would be no more disorder.<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href="#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> The day on
which this letter was despatched had been set apart
by the civic authorities as a day of fasting and
humiliation. Three ministers were appointed to pray
and preach before the mayor, aldermen and common
council at the church of St. Michael Bassishaw that
God might turn away his wrathful indignation against
the city and the nation.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime Fairfax had been informed of
the terrorism brought to bear upon parliament, and
wrote (29 July) from Bedford to the Common Council<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href="#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">792</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saying that, for his part, he looked upon them, being
in authority, as responsible to the kingdom for the
recent disturbances. The letter reached the council
at eleven o'clock at night. In spite of the lateness of
the hour an answer was drawn up<a id="noteref_793" name="noteref_793" href="#note_793"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">793</span></span></a> disclaiming any
responsibility for the riot at Westminster on the ground
that at the time the city was without a settled militia
and held no commission on which to act. So far
from having encouraged the tumult, as many of the
council had been reported to have done, they had
used their best endeavours to allay it. In conclusion
the council declared themselves unconscious of having
contributed to the interruption of the "hopeful way
of peace and settlement" mentioned in the general's
letter, and would accordingly rely upon God for His
protection over the city.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When parliament re-assembled on the 30th the
Speakers of the two Houses and a number of members
failed to appear. New Speakers were immediately
appointed and the expelled members ordered to take
their seats. One of the first acts of the House was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to authorise the militia committee to seize all horses
within the lines of communication for the defence of
parliament and the City, and in accordance with the
City's request sent word to Fairfax not to approach
within thirty miles of London.<a id="noteref_796" name="noteref_796" href="#note_796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a></p>

signified its assent to the appointment of Massey as
commander-in-chief of the city forces, in accordance
with the desire of the militia committee and the
Common Council, and informed a city deputation
that it had taken the precaution to secure the Block-houses

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Common Council was getting more and
more anxious every day. Fairfax had disdained giving
any reply to their last letters, and the army was
known to have already advanced as near as Colnbrook.
On the afternoon of the 2nd August the council
resolved to send another letter to the general,
disclaiming any intention on the part of the city to
raise a new war. The delivery of this despatch was
entrusted to six aldermen and twelve commoners, who
were to remain with the army, in addition to the
commissioners previously appointed, and use every
means in their power to prevent any further bloodshed.
If Fairfax complained that the city was
engaged in raising a body of horse, they were
instructed to throw the responsibility on parliament.
If he objected to the drilling of reformadoes, it was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
again the work of parliament and not of the militia
committee. If the commissioners were asked for
some assurance that the city would protect parliament
in future from all attacks, they were to say that the
city would do its best to protect not only the sitting
members, but all who should return to the House. If
objection was raised to the appointment of Massey,
it was to be laid to the sudden approach of the army.
Should any question arise as to the recent riot at
Westminster, the whole affair was to be ascribed to
the absence of any settled authority of the city militia;
and lastly, if the matter of the petition and engagement
was raked up, the commissioners were to say
that the city had not been the promoters.<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href="#note_798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">798</span></span></a> Furnished
with these instructions, the commissioners set out for
the army, which they found the next day (3 Aug.)
drawn up on Hounslow Heath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime another declaration<a id="noteref_799" name="noteref_799" href="#note_799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a> had been
prepared by Fairfax and the council of war recapitulating
the course affairs had taken, the changes
that had taken place in the government of the city
militia, the pressure that had been put upon parliament
resulting in the Speakers and many members being
driven away, and the continued presence of the eleven
members in the House after charges had been brought
against them, and signifying the intention of the army
to give a welcome to all members of parliament who
found themselves unable to take their seats at
Westminster with freedom and safety, and to regard
them as persons in whom the public trust of the
kingdom still remained. It was moreover the purpose
of the army to march on London, when it was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expected the eleven members would be either
delivered up or else kept in custody until they could
be brought to trial.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the city commissioners arrived at headquarters
this declaration was put into their hands, and
with it they hurried back to London in time to lay
it before the Common Council the same afternoon.
The council was quick to discern that no other course
lay open to them but submission. A letter<a id="noteref_800" name="noteref_800" href="#note_800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">800</span></span></a> was
accordingly despatched to Fairfax the same night, to
the effect that, as it appeared from the declaration
that the main object of the army drawing so near
London was to bring back to a free parliament at
Westminster those members who had withdrawn
owing to the tumult on the 26th July, the Common
Council heartily concurred therein, and no opposition
whatever would be shown to the troops appointed
to escort the members to Westminster. The City
declared itself ready to submit to parliament in everything,
and offered its entire force for its protection.
In order to remove all cause of offence or misunderstanding,
the City's own declaration<a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a> recently published
(30 July) was withdrawn. Under these circumstances
the council expressed a hope that the army would be
prevented from doing any offence or prejudice to the
city or the lines of communication.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City was now all submission. On the 4th
August it agreed to a demand to surrender the forts
from "Giles Forte" down to the river-side, and the
Common Council wrote to Fairfax to that effect,
saying that "now, next unto Almighty God, we do<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rely upon your excellencye's honourable word for

with the army at Hammersmith, whence he wrote to
the City acknowledging their ready compliance in the
surrender of the forts, which he would shortly
garrison, and assuring them that the army would
behave itself in such a manner "as to witness to the
world the integrity of their hearts in having no other
design but the quiet and happy settlement of a firm
and lasting peace."<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 6th August the army entered the lines of
fortification and made its way to Westminster, accompanied
by the Speakers of both Houses and those
members who had betaken themselves to the army
after withdrawing from parliament. The civic
authorities, taking advantage of the hint offered them,
welcomed the army on its approach, the mayor and
aldermen going out as far as Hyde Park in coaches,
whilst the Common Council betook themselves to
Charing Cross by water, and there ranged themselves
in view of the soldiers as they passed.<a id="noteref_804" name="noteref_804" href="#note_804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a> Glyn, the
Recorder, on whose behalf the City had already
addressed Fairfax, was instructed to make a speech
with the view of absolving the City from any implication
in the tumult of the 26th July.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the following day (7 Aug.) the citizens made
a closer acquaintance with the army as it marched
through the heart of the city on its way to Croydon.
The words of Fairfax proved true. The troops
marched through the streets "with all civility, not<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doing the least hurt or prejudice." The civic authorities
felt so much relief at seeing this unexpected maintenance
of discipline that they gave vent to their
feelings by asking Fairfax and all the officers to meet
them at dinner at Grocers' Hall on Thursday, the
13th, but that day proving inconvenient to the general,
who was busy settling the affairs of the army, the
dinner was ordered to be put off until the city should
again hear from him.<a id="noteref_805" name="noteref_805" href="#note_805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a> The termination of hostilities

of the army waited on the Common Council
and demanded an advance of a month's pay
(£50,000). The City was to re-imburse itself out
of the arrears which the citizens had failed to
contribute to the army, and which amounted to
over £60,000. The matter was referred to a committee.<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href="#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a>

that its "engagement" of the 21st July had been the
occasion of the army approaching London, and its
failing to pay the money as it became due was the
occasion of keeping the army near London. If the
citizens failed to take the necessary steps for the
removal of the army, "they must expect to suffer the
inconveniences that will come hereby."<a id="noteref_815" name="noteref_815" href="#note_815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a> To this
the City replied (6 Sept.) that whatever arrears of
assessments were due they were not due from the
Common Council as a body, for that had never been
assessed, but were due from particular individuals.
The council feared that it would be impossible to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
raise the money on the security offered, but it promised
to use its best endeavours to raise it if some
better security were found, and to get in arrears of
assessments at the same time. As to the "engagement,"
they called God to witness that the Common
Council as a body had had no hand in it; but as
soon as a copy of it was received from the army,
the council returned answer that "according to their
duty they did rest in that which both Houses
of Parliament had resolved hereupon." In that
resolution the council expressed itself as still remaining
and altogether disavowed the "engagement."
It even ventured to hope that the House would not
permit such a mark of its displeasure to remain on
record, reflecting so badly as it did upon the whole
City.<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This reply being deemed unsatisfactory the
Commons sent a more peremptory demand (9 Sept.)
to the effect that not only the sum of £50,000 should
be advanced by the City before the 18th September,
but that also the whole of the arrears, amounting to
£64,000, should be levied,<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> and they got Fairfax himself

Fairfax and the General Council of the Army proposed
to parliament, that unless the arrears came in by a
certain day the general himself should be authorised
to levy them and to inflict fines upon delinquents.
This withholding the money by the City, said they,
was but a scheme for bringing the army into disrepute,
and for the purpose of causing disturbance; the
Common Council had been ready enough to advance
far larger sums to encourage designs against parliament
and the army; it might again be induced to show a
similar readiness in providing money, without which
the army could not disperse, if parliament would but
impose a fine upon them as a body, "which money
being chargeable so properly upon themselves, we<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before any further steps were taken to enforce
the loan the committee appointed to investigate the
outrage upon parliament in July reported (24 Sept.)
to the House that they had discovered sufficient
evidence for the impeachment of Sir John Gayer,
the mayor, Thomas Cullum, one of the sheriffs,
and three aldermen of the city, viz., James Bunce,
John Langham and Thomas Adams, on the charge
of threatening the Commons with force and raising
a fresh war.<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href="#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> The House at once accepted the
committee's report and ordered the accused parties
to the Tower. On the following day it took into
consideration the question as to how the city government
was to be carried on in the absence of the
mayor, and resolved to refer the matter to the rest of
the aldermen who happened to be in London at the
time, so that the civil government might continue
"according to the charters, custom or usage of the

Alderman Pennington, in whom both Houses had

direct that a Common Hall should be forthwith
called for the purpose of electing someone to serve as
mayor "until the 29th October next, or until Sir<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A letter from Fairfax, dated at Kingston the

on the city to assist the municipal authorities in
getting in arrears of assessments due to the army,
created no little alarm in the city. Whilst the
Common Council was deliberating on the matter
news was brought that the Earl of Northumberland
and a deputation from both Houses were waiting
without the Council Chamber desiring to speak with
some members of the court. A similar intimation to
that contained in the letter of Fairfax had been made<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to parliament, and both Houses were anxious to urge
upon the city the extreme importance of anticipating
such a step as that which Fairfax threatened by
getting in the arrears of assessments as speedily
as possible. This the council expressed itself as
very willing to do if parliament would relieve the
collectors of certain pains and penalties recently
imposed on them, which had only served to render
them the more unwilling to execute their duties.<a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830" href="#note_830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a></p>

expressed great regret if the arrears due from the City
to the army, or anything else connected with the City,
should be the cause of the army continuing so long in
the vicinity of London, to the great prejudice if not to
the ruin of many. They were doing all they could
to get in the arrears, and they called the general's
attention to certain proposals which they were about
to submit to parliament. They concluded by assuring
Fairfax that the City was determined to remain faithful
to parliament and the kingdom, and at the same time
to cultivate good relations with the army.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City's proposals, which were submitted to
parliament on the 22nd November, met with little
favour in the House of Commons. The deputation
presenting them was somewhat bluntly informed that
parliament had done what it had judged fit in the
matter of the City's arrears; that it was much

being got in; that the City was setting a very bad
example to others which might have ill consequences;
that the commands of parliament were expected to
be obeyed, and that prompt measures ought to be
taken by the City to carry them out.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a></p>

as soon as the king's escape (11 Nov.) from Hampton
Court did away with the necessity of its presence in
the immediate neighbourhood of London, informing
the authorities that as parliament had raised an
objection to his sending troops to the city for the
purpose of getting in arrears, he was content to wait
and see the result of parliamentary action in the
matter and whether the City's recent promises bore
fruit or not. Should the result prove unsatisfactory,
he doubted not the consequences would be sad, "and
that not more to the parliament, kingdom or army
than to the city itself."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 1st December Alderman Bide, who had
narrowly escaped impeachment with Gayer and the
rest, and who was now sheriff, presented a petition to
the Commons on behalf of the City. This petition,
which had been ordered to be prepared as far back as
the 6th November—that is to say, before Charles's
escape from Hampton Court and the withdrawal of
the army to Windsor—after expressing the City's
humble submission to parliament and its appreciation
of the many benefits it had derived from the course
which parliament had followed, prayed the House to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
take steps for the removal of the army to a greater
distance from the city and for the strict observance
of the Covenant, and concluded by asking for the
release of their Recorder and of the aldermen recently
committed to prison.<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href="#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> The Journal of the House
records nothing more than the formal answer which
the Commons returned to the petition: their thanks
to the City for expressions of goodwill, their readiness
to consider such matters referred to in the petition as
had not been already taken in hand, and their assurance
that speedy justice should be done to those imprisoned.<a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href="#note_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a>
But from other sources it appears that the petition
created considerable ill-feeling in the House, and that it
was only after Vane had threatened to bring the army
back again that the petition was practically rejected.
Had the petitioners succeeded in their object it was
expected that the Presbyterians in parliament and in
the city would have followed up their victory by
restoring the expelled members and preparing for a
personal treaty with Charles without imposing upon
him any test whatever.<a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the city the royalist cause was gaining ground
every day. The merchant was tired of the disquietude
that had so long prevailed, condemning him
to frequent calls upon his purse whilst preventing
him replenishing it by his commercial pursuits. He
was ready to support any party that would promise
him peace and quiet. "The citty is subject still to
be ridden by every party and wilbe so rather than
endanger trade and stock," wrote a royalist in March<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the shopkeeper was indignant at having to close his
shop on Christmas-day for fear of a riot, notwithstanding
his having parliamentary sanction for opening
it. The city apprentices resisted the interference of
the lord mayor and his officers who would have
put a stop to their decorating a pump in Cornhill
with evergreens at Christmas, and not only did
ministers who had been deprived for malignancy
occupy pulpits in various city churches on that day,
but they used the Book of Common Prayer.<a id="noteref_840" name="noteref_840" href="#note_840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">840</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mayor, who owed his election to pressure
of parliament, and who was on that account never
really popular in the city, unwittingly assisted the
royal cause by another act of injudicious meddling.
On Sunday, the 9th April, 1648, he sent a detachment
of trained bands to interfere with the amusement of
some boys playing tip-cat in Moorfields. A crowd of
apprentices and others took the part of the boys, and
attacked the trained bands, getting possession of their
arms and colours. With these they marched, some
three or four thousand strong, along Fleet Street and
the Strand, raising the shout of "Now for King
Charles!" and intending to make their way to Whitehall,
but before they reached Charing Cross they were
scattered by a troop of cavalry quartered at the
King's Mews, and for a time the disturbance was at<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an end. During the night, however, the apprentices
again arose and made themselves masters of Ludgate
and Newgate. Laying their hands on whatever
ammunition they could find, and summoning their
friends by drums belonging to the trained bands, they
proceeded to attack the mansion of the unpopular
mayor. Whilst a messenger was hurrying off to
Fairfax for military aid, the mayor, the sheriffs
and the Committee of Militia had to repel as best
they could the attacks of the mob, who kept firing
through the windows of the lord mayor's house. At
last the troops arrived, and were admitted into the
city by Aldersgate. They followed up the rioters to
the Leadenhall, where arms were being collected.
Resistance to a disciplined force soon proved useless.
The ringleaders were taken and led off to prison, and
the crowd was dispersed, but not without some little
bloodshed.<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841" href="#note_841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a> The affair made the city poorer by the
sum of £300, that amount being voted by the Court
of Aldermen out of the city's cash to the officers and
soldiers sent by Fairfax to suppress the riot.<a id="noteref_842" name="noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a></p>

to both Houses an account of what had recently

Parliament accepted their assurance that they were in
no way responsible for the outbreak, and thanked the
mayor and all others concerned for the part they had
taken in its suppression. A day was appointed for a
public thanksgiving for deliverance from the threatened
danger. The Tower garrison was augmented and the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
city's chains removed, in view of a recurrence of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Six months and more had now passed since
Gayer, the late deposed mayor, and his brother
aldermen had been committed to prison, and no steps
had as yet been taken to bring them to trial. At
length articles of impeachment were drawn up by the
Commons and sent up to the Lords (15 April),<a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href="#note_844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a>
charging him with having on the 26th July last past,
in conjunction with Thomas Adams, John Langham,
James Bunce, aldermen of the city and others,
"maliciously and traitorously plotted and endeavoured
with open force and violence, and with armed
power, to compel and enforce the Lords and Commons
then assembled in parliament at Westminster
to alter the laws and ordinances by parliament
established for the safety and weal of the realm;
and likewise maliciously and traitorously raised and
levied war against the king, parliament and kingdom."
Gayer took exception to the jurisdiction of the House,
and when brought before the Lords and ordered to
kneel at the bar as a delinquent refused to do anything
of the kind, for which contempt he was fined
£500. After hearing the articles of impeachment
read, he declared that he disavowed and abhorred the
offences with which he was charged, and asked to be
furnished with a copy of them. He further desired
the assistance of counsel and time to answer them,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both of which were allowed.<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href="#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a> When his brother
aldermen and fellow prisoners appeared before the
Lords to hear their several charges read to them and
were ordered to kneel as delinquents, they too refused.
Like Gayer they were severally fined<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> and relegated
to the Tower, whence they had been brought. There
the four aldermen remained prisoners until a crisis
arrived in the following June, when the Commons,
fearing to alienate the city at a time when the enemy
was almost at its gates, declared (3 June) that they
would proceed no further with the charges.<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> The

The object for which this step was being taken

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matters were made worse by the continued
ill-feeling between the City and the English army,
whose pay was still largely in arrear. No threats of
Fairfax or of parliament had succeeded in making the
inhabitants of the city pay up their arrears of assessments,
and unless these were paid the soldiers had
no alternative but to starve or render themselves
obnoxious to the nation by living at free quarters.
The City had been already charged with withholding
money for the express purpose of driving the army to
the latter alternative, that so the nation might the
quicker be free of it. The army was fast losing
patience, and there was some talk of it taking the law
into its own hands.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 24th April the mayor informed the citizens

information from one John Everard of certain matters
which the informer pretended to have overheard at
Windsor greatly affecting the city. He had examined
Everard on oath, and the result of the examination
being then openly read, it was resolved to lay the

was laid before both Houses, together with a petition
from the municipal authorities that the chains which
had been recently removed from the streets of the

wishes in the matter of replacing the chains and the
appointment of Skippon, so that these concessions
were readily made, but the question of removing the
army could only be decided with the concurrence of
the army itself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A member of the Common Council, Philip Chetwyn,
was charged with having publicly declared that Skippon's
appointment was not the real wish of the
court, and that "seaven lies" had been voted by the
court on the 11th April last.<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href="#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a> Chetwyn gave an
emphatic denial to the first charge, and eventually
both charges were allowed to drop. The council at
the same time passed a resolution to the effect that
whenever a charge should in future be made by one
member of the court against another, and the court
take cognisance of it, the charge itself and the names
of the accuser and the accused should be expressed in
the order of the court.<a id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854" href="#note_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City lost no time in availing itself of the
assent of parliament to replace the chains in the
streets from which they had been removed. They<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
went further than this. From Saturday night to the
following Monday night (28-30 May) the gates and
posterns were ordered to be kept closed and guarded,
the names of all lodgers were to be taken, vagrant
soldiers were to be ordered to their quarters, whilst
servants and children were to be confined indoors,
except on the Sunday that intervened, when they
might be escorted to church by their parents or
masters.<a id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855" href="#note_855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a> The reason for these precautions was that
there had been unmistakable signs of the army getting
out of hand. An unexpected danger, the revolt of
the whole of South Wales, which meant nothing less
than the renewal of the war, served, however, to
consolidate the ranks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With Wales up in arms for the king and the
north of England threatened with a Scottish invasion
the army had enough to do without keeping a forcible
hold on London. The City, therefore, had to be left
to itself, and to be kept in good humour by concessions
rather than by force until the trouble had passed away.
The story goes that before Cromwell proceeded to
quell the rebellion in Wales the Council of War
resolved that the City should have all they asked or
desired, "there being no other way for the present to
quiet them." It would be time enough when the enemy
had been beaten to "make the City pay for all."<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 1st May Fairfax wrote to the Commons
from Windsor announcing his intention to despatch
Cromwell into Wales and to withdraw the regiments<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
quartered at Whitehall and Charing Cross, leaving the
protection of parliament to the London forces under
the command of Skippon. The same day that the
Commons received this letter (2 May) they communicated
with the Common Council of the city, who were
delighted at the execution of their long expressed
wishes that the army should be removed from the
vicinity of London and at the compliment paid them
by Fairfax in placing the protection of parliament in
their hands. The sum of £600 a year was voted to
Skippon for his services, a sum just double that
allowed him on his appointment as sergeant-major-general
in January, 1642.<a id="noteref_857" name="noteref_857" href="#note_857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a> Fairfax wrote him a
friendly letter complimenting him on his past services
to parliament and the kingdom and expressing regret
at parting from him. He at the same time disengaged
Skippon from all ties to himself and the army under
his command, and wished him much happiness in his
new sphere.<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The civic authorities were not slow to take
advantage of the turn of affairs. If they were to be
responsible for the protection of parliament and the
peace of the city, surely, they reasoned, the appointment
of their own Committee of Militia should be left
in their hands as well as the custody of the Tower.
Both Houses accordingly were approached with
petitions to this effect (9 May).<a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a> The Lords

the several names of persons chosen (12th May) by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 19th a deputation of Lords and Commons
waited on the Common Council and informed them
that both Houses had assented to their wishes. In
return for this favour parliament expected that the
City would secure them from tumult and insurrections,
and "did now put themselves really and truly into
the hands of the city." The court was at the same
time assured that parliament meditated no alteration
of the fundamental government of the kingdom by
king, lords and commons, that it was resolved to
stand by the solemn league and covenant and preserve
the treaties between England and Scotland.<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more at an important crisis in England's
history all depended upon the attitude of the city of
London. "The key of the situation was in the hands
of the city, which had it in its power to paralyse the
army by simply maintaining an attitude of passive
resistance."<a id="noteref_865" name="noteref_865" href="#note_865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a> But great as was the detestation in
which the army was held by the majority of citizens,
their distrust of the royalists, should they regain
the upper hand, was greater. Under the circumstances
the City resolved to maintain its attitude
of standing by parliament, and gave its assurance to
both Houses that it was ready "to live and die<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Four days later (23 May) the City presented a
petition to both Houses in which, after acknowledging
the joy and comfort they had derived from the recent
announcement made to them that parliament was
resolved to make no constitutional change in the
government of the kingdom by king, lords and
commons, and other matters conducive to peace, the
citizens prayed that the Houses would release their
Recorder, the aldermen and the rest of the citizens
that were still imprisoned in the Tower. The
Commons replied by at once ordering the release
of Glyn and nine other prisoners, and promised to
take into consideration the release of the aldermen,
which was a more serious business, in a week's
time.<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href="#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parliament was the more anxious to conciliate
the City inasmuch as a royalist rising had already
taken place in Kent (21 May). On the 26th May a
deputation from the Commons waited on the Common
Council with a request for an immediate advance of
£6,000. A portion of the money was to be devoted
to the payment of Fairfax's soldiers, "to enable them
to march out," and give place to the city's own force
under Colonel West. The money was at once voted,<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href="#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a>
and Fairfax, after giving orders for securing Southwark,
proceeded to occupy Blackheath, the place appointed
for the rendezvous of the insurgents.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst Fairfax was engaged in putting down the
rising in Kent the royalist party in the city was not
inactive. On the 30th May a petition was presented
to the Common Council, purporting to emanate from
"divers well affected citizens and other inhabitants"
of the city, desiring the court to approach parliament
with the view (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inter alia</span></span>) of bringing about a personal
treaty with the king and appeasing the Kentish
insurgents "by way of accommodation and not by

practice the court consented to forward the petition
to both Houses, which it did on the 1st June, with
the result that a deputation from parliament waited
on the court that same afternoon with a verbal reply.
The precise terms of the reply are not recorded.
We are only told that after a "full and large
declaration" made by the parliamentary members, the
council expressed itself as completely satisfied.<a id="noteref_870" name="noteref_870" href="#note_870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">870</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An appeal was made the same day (1 June) by a
certain section of the inhabitants of the city for a
Common Hall to be summoned. The appeal was
made to the Common Council. The court took time
to consider the matter. After consulting the law-officers
it was eventually agreed not to accede to the
request, on the plea that, although it was in the power
of the court to assemble the livery for the election
of public officers and other purposes as might be
necessary for the public good of the city, it was neither
fit nor convenient to summon them at the present
juncture on account of the present distraction and
distempers of the city and places adjacent.<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871" href="#note_871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days later (3 June), when a deputation from
parliament again appeared before the Common Council
with the news that the insurgents were making their
way to Blackheath under the leadership of the Earl
of Norwich, otherwise known as "Lord Goring,"
and asked that the Militia Committee might speedily
raise what force it could for the protection of parliament
and the city, the opportunity was again taken
of pressing the Houses for the release of the aldermen,
an act which they were assured "would give good
satisfaction to the city and very much quiet their
minds."<a id="noteref_872" name="noteref_872" href="#note_872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a> That same afternoon the Commons resolved
to proceed no further with the impeachments
of the aldermen, and on the 6th they were set free
by order of the House of Lords.<a id="noteref_873" name="noteref_873" href="#note_873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">873</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parliament could not well have done otherwise,
unless they wished to lose their main support—the
support of the City; for although the Earl of Norwich
found the city's gates shut against him, as was
to be expected with Warner occupying the mayoralty
chair and Skippon in command of the trained bands,
there was, as we have seen, a considerable party in
the city who favoured the royalist cause and would
gladly have trusted Charles if they dared.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor were the municipal authorities themselves
adverse to the restoration of the king, but such
restoration must be effected on their own terms.
Again and again they called upon parliament to open
a personal treaty with Charles. On the 22nd June
the Common Council directed a petition to both<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Houses to be drafted, thanking them for setting the

that they were using their best endeavours in the

made to the king, as well as of "time, place and
other circumstances for convenience of address to be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week later (5 July) the Common Council
introduced to the House of Lords another petition, in
which the officers of the trained bands of the city
made a similar request for a personal treaty to be
made with the king in London, and not only repeated
a former request made by the City itself that the
London regiments might be associated with those of
the adjacent counties, but asked that the force thus
formed might be furnished with a contingent of
cavalry. To all these requests the Lords gave a ready
assent.<a id="noteref_877" name="noteref_877" href="#note_877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">877</span></span></a> The Commons, however, to whom a similar

left the other matters for further consideration, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appointed a committee to confer with the Common

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question to be considered was the steps to
be taken for the security of the king's person in
the event of his taking up his quarters in London for
the purpose of negotiating. The Common Council,
for their part, undertook in such an event to venture
their lives and fortunes in defending his majesty
against all violence according to the covenant, and
appointed a committee to confer with the parliamentary
committee and with the military officers as
to the best means of enabling them to carry out this
engagement.<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href="#note_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the 11th July the committee was in a position
to report to the Common Council the result of the

committee had propounded seven questions
bearing upon the terms of the City's engagement to
protect the king against violence pending negotiations,
and its intentions as to the king's person in the event
of such negotiations falling through. To these the
city committee had made replies (now submitted to
the council for approval), and had added certain
propositions to the parliamentary committee to enable
the City the better to carry out its engagement. The
first two of these related to the amalgamation and
increase of the militia; the third asked that, pending
negotiations, no force should be allowed to come
within thirty miles of London, and that riot and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tumult raised in the city during that period after
proclamation made should be met with a death
penalty; and the last that if parliament so willed no
one who had ever taken up arms against it should be
allowed within thirty miles of London without leave.
Both the answers and proposals of the city committee
were alike approved by the council, and a house-to-house
visitation was organised for the purpose of
getting names subscribed to the city's engagement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The demand for a death penalty on rioters in the
city was not unwarranted. There were not wanting
signs of disaffection even in the ranks of the city's
militia. So recently as Saturday, the 8th July, the
Speaker himself, whilst being escorted to his coach by
a company of soldiers, had been insulted by one in
the ranks, who cried out to the surrounding mob "that

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was known that about this time secret enlistments
were being carried on in the city, and that
horses were being despatched out of the city by twos
and threes to assist the royalists. It was also
reported that an attempt was about to be made to
seize the Tower.<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href="#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a> The majority of the inhabitants,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nevertheless, remained faithful to parliament, and the
Speaker took the opportunity of a petition addressed
to both Houses (12 July) from "divers well-affected
magistrates, citizens, ministers and other inhabitants"
of the city and parts adjacent, praying them to enter
into no treaty without proper assurances for the
maintenance of the covenant,<a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885" href="#note_885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a> to compliment the
aldermen and great magistrates of the city on their
courage and fidelity. It was a petition—the Speaker
said, addressing the deputation—for peace, and such
peace as the House and all honest men desired. It
had come at a most seasonable time, when parliament
was the object of much abuse and men dared not own
their true opinions. The petition was the more
valuable from the quality of the petitioners—"divers
aldermen and great magistrates of the city of
London, many reverend ministers, who have always
held close to the cause, and others, the gentlemen of
birth and quality that have less valued their blood
than the hazard and loss of so noble an undertaking."
On behalf of the Commons he returned them real
and hearty thanks, assuring them that the House
approved of the petition and the matter thereof, and
that in prosecuting the peace it would take care to
preserve the religion, laws and liberties of all those
who have been constant to these ends.<a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href="#note_886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 18th July the City caused two petitions to
be presented to both Houses, one of which asked for
an impost to be laid on Newcastle coals, and the other
repeated the old request for an amalgamation of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
city's militia with that of the neighbouring counties.
To the first no answer was vouchsafed. To the
second the Commons replied that the matter had
already been referred to a committee; whilst the
Lords directed an ordinance to be drawn up pursuant
to the wishes of the petitioners. The petition relative
to the militia was met by a counter-petition from
"divers well-affected citizens of London and inhabitants
in and about the same," the authors of which
the Common Council wished to discover.<a id="noteref_887" name="noteref_887" href="#note_887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime enlistments of horse and foot had
been to such an extent carried on clandestinely in
the city, under pretext of the parliamentary powers
granted to Skippon, that the municipal authorities
began to get nervous. Servants and apprentices were
reported to have enlisted one another at all hours of the
night, and to have issued spurious commissions. Against
the continuation of such proceedings, which threatened
the city with danger, the authorities petitioned both
Houses (22 July). The Lords consented to revoke
a commission granted to Skippon to raise a troop of
cavalry for the protection of parliament, independently
of the Committee of Militia; the Commons, on the
other hand, determined to let the order stand.<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href="#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a> The
civic authorities thereupon yielded to the entreaties of
the inhabitants of the city, and resolved (27 July) to
raise a troop of horse on their own account to be
subject to the orders of the Militia Committee alone.
On the 29th they again petitioned the Commons.<a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href="#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
That day being Saturday the House appointed a
committee to confer with the Common Council on
the following Monday afternoon, and undertook to
put a stop to irregular enlistments in the future.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href="#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Monday came a deputation from the
Commons duly appeared and explained the reasons
for continuing Skippon's commission and the measures
that were to be taken to prevent irregular enlistments.
Several letters were read for the purpose of demonstrating
the dangers with which the country was still
threatened, among them being one from a royalist
agent in London, in which the writer informed his
correspondent of the progress of the royalist cause in
the city. "We are in this city," he declared,
"generally right; only Skippon makes some disturbance
by listing horse and foot, which, though
inconsiderable to what we have listed for us, yet we
hope not only to null his listing, but out him from
his being general of this city. The Lords have
already done something, but wait for some further
encouragement from hence, to which purpose the
Common Council are about framing a petition."<a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href="#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a>
The reading of this letter appears to have had a
diametrically opposite effect upon the members of the
council than was anticipated, for they still insisted
upon the withdrawal of Skippon's authority under
which the irregular enlistments were carried on. The
Commons, however, refused to be moved from their
former resolution.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 2nd August a letter from the Prince of
Wales, who had recently arrived with a fleet off
Yarmouth, was read to the Common Council. The
letter had been forwarded to its destination by the
company of merchant adventurers, and contained a
copy of the prince's declaration to the effect that he
was approaching the shores of England to settle
religion in accordance with the terms of the agreement
between his father and the Scots, to restore the
king to his throne, and to bring about an act of
oblivion and the disbandment of all armies.<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a> He
had recently seized several merchantmen in the

the money to set the vessels free.<a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href="#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a></p>

as to put an end to the present troubles and miseries.
After sending for the original letter the Commons
directed (3 Aug.) the City to make no reply to the

of the terms offered. It was still believed by
many that as soon as he should raise his standard in
the north the Presbyterians in the city would openly
avow themselves in his favour, and rumour had gone
so far as to name the commanders of their forces.
"The lords and the city," wrote one of Rupert's

acceded to this request as to take immediate steps

appeared before the Common Council and
asked for a loan of £10,000, to be paid by weekly

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prospect of negotiations being opened at all
with the king was distasteful to the radical party or
"Levellers" in the city, and a petition was laid before
the Commons on the 11th September calling upon
them as the supreme authority in the realm to shake
off all control exercised over them by the House of
Lords, and to render kings, queens, nobles and all
persons alike subject to the law of the land. The
petitioners finally asked the House to consider
seriously "whether the justice of God be likely to be
satisfied or His yet continuing wrath appeased by
an Act of Oblivion."<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This petition had little effect upon the House,

and no more. They, however, continued to be carried
on long after the allotted time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in November parliament was again pressed
for money and was forced to apply to the City for a
further loan of £4,000 to enable it to proceed with
the "Treaty." It at the same time complained of
the inadequate guard provided by the City for the
protection of the Houses. The guard, it was said,
consisted of hired men, and not citizens, who often
quitted their posts when on duty. The subject led to
an acrimonious debate in the Common Council. As
soon as Alderman Gibbs, who was a member of the
Militia Committee, began to suggest a remedy for the
evil, he was interrupted by Philip Chetwyn, whose
plain speaking had once before created trouble, and
who now boldly charged the alderman and others
with telling "many long stories to put the city in fear
without cause." He declared that at a former council
the alderman had acted in a similar way, "pretending
that the city was in great danger of having their
throats cut whereas there was no such cause." This
speech brought other members of the council on their
legs in defence of the alderman, who declared that
this was not the first time that Chetwyn had done
him wrong, and asked the court to right him. What
he had said at a former council about the danger the
city was in was nothing more than what the Militia
Committee had authorised him to say, and this
statement was corroborated by other members of the
committee then present. Certain questions were
thereupon put to the vote, when it was decided (1)
that Chetwyn had done the alderman a wrong by his
speech, (2) that what the alderman had spoken at a
former council was warranted by the Militia Committee,
and (3) that the action by the committee on<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that occasion had been for the safety of the city,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the end of November the army, now at
Windsor, had entirely lost patience both with king and
parliament, and on the last day of the month issued a
declaration to the effect that it was about to appeal
"unto the extraordinary judgment of God and good
people." The existing parliament must be dissolved to
give place to a succession of reformed parliaments.
Those members who agreed with the army were invited
to leave the House and join the army to form a kind
of provisional government until elections for a new
parliament could take place, when the army would
willingly disband.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That same night (30 Nov.) whilst the mayor was

Strictly speaking, the mayor had no right to open a

thought otherwise and broke the seal; a proceeding

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of a request by the Commons that he
would keep at a distance, lest his approach should
involve danger, Fairfax entered London with his
troops on Saturday, the 2nd December, and took up
his quarters at Whitehall. On Wednesday, the 6th—the
day on which Colonel Pride administered his
famous "purge" to the House of Commons—a letter
from the general was read in the Common Council in
which he desired that 3,800 beds might be sent to
Whitehall by ten o'clock the next morning for the use
of the soldiers, and also sufficient furniture for lodging.
The beds and furniture were to be afterwards
returned.<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href="#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Common Council immediately nominated a
committee to go to Fairfax and to beg him to excuse
the City furnishing the beds as desired. The committee
was further instructed to inform his lordship that if he
would obtain a warrant from the Committee of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Army to the Treasurers at War for the payment of
£10,000, the City would be prepared to pay over the
whole sum of £40,000 (which ought to have been
already paid over) by the next day (7 Dec). There
was one other matter. A rumour had reached the
city that it was intended to arrest Major-General
Browne, who at the time was serving as one of the
sheriffs of London, and the committee were directed
to point out to his excellency the "inconveniences"
likely to arise from such a proceeding.<a id="noteref_909" name="noteref_909" href="#note_909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">909</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fairfax paid little regard to what might or might
not be convenient for the City, and on the 12th Browne
was arrested, together with Waller, Massey and others,
on the charge of having joined in an invitation to the
Scots to invade England, although it was difficult to
find evidence against them. The Court of Aldermen
immediately interested themselves in endeavouring to
obtain Browne's release, guaranteeing to Fairfax, if he
would set the sheriff free, to produce him whenever

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finding that the money (£40,000) which he had
ordered the City to furnish was not forthcoming on the
day appointed, Fairfax notified the Common Council
by letter (8 Dec.) that he had given orders for seizing
the treasury at Goldsmiths' Hall and Weavers'
Hall. The sum of £27,400 was accordingly seized
at the latter Hall; and this sum Fairfax intended to
keep until the £40,000 should be paid. When that
was done he would withdraw his troops, and not
before. On learning this the Common Council sent a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deputation to inform his excellency that, if certain
concessions were made, the City itself would be
responsible for repayment of the money seized, and
that arrears should be got in as speedily as possible.
At the same time Fairfax was asked to withdraw his
troops from the city.<a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href="#note_911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these proposals Fairfax replied by letter the

charged on the City for the army up to the 25th March
next ensuing, and still in arrear, to be brought in within
fourteen days, he would repay the money taken from
Weavers' Hall and would withdraw his troops. Their
presence in the city he affected to conceive would
facilitate the collection of the money. On the receipt
of this letter the civic authorities renewed their
exertions to hasten the getting in of assessments.<a id="noteref_913" name="noteref_913" href="#note_913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was thought that a saving might be effected
by the discontinuance of the trained bands in their
duty of guarding the city. They were known to be
very remiss in their duties, piling their arms and
leaving them in charge of some few of their number
whilst the others went away and amused themselves.
They had thus become a laughing-stock to the better
disciplined soldiers of the army, and brought discredit
on the city. The question was eventually left to the
discretion of the Militia Committee to continue the
guards or not as it might think fit.<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite, however, of every effort the money

became an intolerable burden. On Saturday, the 6th
January, 1649, a fortnight's pay, or, £19,000, was due
to the soldiers, and unless the money was found
within four days Fairfax threatened to quarter his
whole army upon the city. A house-to-house visitation
for getting in arrears was organised. A short
extension of time for payment to the army was
asked for and obtained. Ministers were charged to
exhort their parishioners on the intervening Sunday
to pay up their arrears. The money was eventually
advanced by the Treasurers at War on the personal
security of the aldermen and wealthier inhabitants of
each ward.<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href="#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The feeling of detestation for the army and of
inclination towards the king had in the meanwhile
been growing stronger in the city day by day. A
royalist lord mayor, in the person of Abraham Reynardson,
had recently been elected, and it was feared
by parliament—or the Rump, as it came to be called—that
the same royalist proclivities would show
themselves in the elections to the Common Council
which were to take place on St. Thomas's day (21
Dec.). An ordinance was accordingly passed on the
18th against the election of "malignants" to the city
council. This ordinance was amended two days
later (20 Dec.) in such a way as to exclude every
citizen who had subscribed to an engagement for a
personal treaty with the king.<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916" href="#note_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a> It was in vain that
representation was made to parliament of the difficulty
of getting a council together under such a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
restriction. The House was inflexible and ordered the
election to be at once proceeded with. The election
accordingly took place, but when the members came
to take their seats the mayor forbade them unless
they were prepared to take the oath of allegiance,
which had not yet been abolished. This action on
the part of Reynardson being reported to the House,
it directed him (5 Jan., 1649) to forthwith summon
the Common Council together, but to suspend the
taking of oaths until further order.<a id="noteref_917" name="noteref_917" href="#note_917"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">917</span></span></a> It at the
same time gave orders for the city chains to be
removed and stored in the Leadenhall, the easier
to put down any disturbance that might arise in
consequence of the recent elections.<a id="noteref_918" name="noteref_918" href="#note_918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">918</span></span></a> The effect

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 13th January, by which day a High
Court of Justice had been especially established for
the king's trial and all royalists had been banished
the city by order of Fairfax,<a id="noteref_919" name="noteref_919" href="#note_919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a> the new Common
Council began to assert itself. The court had been
summoned to meet at eight o'clock in the morning
(not an unusually early hour in those days), but the
mayor did not put in an appearance until eleven, and
then was only accompanied by two aldermen, the
number necessary to form a court. It was soon seen
that there was something wrong. The mayor refused
to acknowledge the authority of the council or to
allow the minutes of the last court to be read in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accordance with custom. The council took but little
notice of this and passed on to the next business.
This was a petition to the House of Commons, drawn
up and approved by a committee,<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a> asking the House
to execute justice impartially and vigorously "upon
all the grand and capital authors, contrivers of and
actors in the late wars against parliament and
kingdom, from the highest to the lowest," and to
take steps, as the supreme power of the nation, for
the preservation of peace and the recovery of trade
and credit.<a id="noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href="#note_921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a> Such a petition was so diametrically
opposed to the sentiments of the royalist lord mayor
and his brother aldermen that they got up and left the
court rather than allow the petition to be sanctioned by
their presence. Strictly speaking there was no longer
any court. Nevertheless an attempt was made to
get the Common Sergeant and then the Town Clerk<a id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922" href="#note_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a>
to put the question, but they refused to do so in the
absence of the mayor and aldermen, and they too got
up and left the council chamber. Thus left to themselves
the members of the court voted Colonel Owen
Rowe into the chair. The petition was then three
times read, and after due deliberation unanimously
agreed to, twenty members of the council being
nominated to carry it up to the House, together with<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a narrative of the proceedings that had taken place
that day in court.<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href="#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In submitting the petition to the Commons on the
15th January, Colonel Robert Tichborne, a member
of the council, explained the reason why the petition
varied in title from other petitions from the city,
purporting, as it did, to come from the commons of
the city alone, and not from the mayor, aldermen and
commons, and with the petition presented a narrative
of the proceedings that had taken place in the council
two days before.<a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href="#note_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a> The House readily accepted the
explanation (as was only to be expected), and declared
that the petition and narrative might and should of
right be entered on the records of the Common
Council. "As to the Common Council of the city of
London, and so owned by this House"—the Speaker
went on to say—"they take notice of the extraordinary
affections long since and often expressed
by many particular persons, if not by every member
of your present body, especially of that true and
publick principle which carried you on to the framing
of this petition, and to your going through with it,
notwithstanding the opposition and withdrawing of
your mayor and aldermen." The Speaker assured
the deputation that the House fully approved of the
members continuing to sit as a Common Council in
the absence or dissent of the mayor or aldermen, or
both together, and concluded by saying that both the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
petition and narrative would receive speedy consideration.<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="#note_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 23rd January two officers from the army
waited upon the Court of Aldermen and informed the
members that the sum of £4,000 out of the £19,000
formerly demanded for the army was still in arrear.
The money was in the hands of the Treasurers at War,
but they refused to pay it over until they had received
their security from the wards according to agreement.
Fairfax pressed for an immediate payment, otherwise
he would be under the necessity of quartering troops
of horse and foot upon those wards which had failed
to give the promised security for arrears of assessments.
Rather than this should happen the aldermen
themselves engaged to be security to the treasurers
for payment of the money.<a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926" href="#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile the special tribunal established
for the trial of the king had commenced its work. At
its head sat John Bradshaw, a sergeant-at-law and
sometime a judge of the sheriffs' court of the Wood
Street compter in the city.<a id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href="#note_927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> Five aldermen were
placed on the commission, viz., Isaac Pennington,
Thomas Andrews, Thomas Atkins, Rowland Wilson
and John Fowke;<a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928" href="#note_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> but only the first two named took
any active part in the trial, and Wilson absolutely
declined to serve. Not one of them affixed his signature
to the king's death-warrant. Among the rest
of the commissioners were, however, two citizens of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
repute, viz., Robert Tichborne, afterwards an alderman,<a id="noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a>
and Owen Rowe, both of whom took an active
part in the trial and both signed the warrant for the
king's execution. When put upon his trial in October,
1660, for the part he now took, Tichborne pleaded that
what he had done was through ignorance, and that had
he known more he would sooner have entered a "red
hot oven" than the room in which the warrant was
signed.<a id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href="#note_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a> His penitence saved his life, and he, like
Pennington, spent the remainder of his days in confinement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proceedings of the trial were unreasonably
short and sharp. On Friday, the 19th January,
Charles was brought from Windsor to London. On
the following day he made his first appearance before
his judges. On that day week—Saturday, the 27th—sentence
was pronounced, and three days later
(30 Jan.) it was carried out before the king's own
banquetting-house at Whitehall.</p>

They next proceeded (14 Feb.) to place

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revolution which was taking place in the
government of the kingdom found its counterpart in
the municipal government of the City, where the
mayor, aldermen and commons bore close analogy
to the king, lords and commons of the realm. The
City was but the kingdom in miniature, the kingdom
was but the City writ large. No sooner was the
house of lords abolished, and with it the right of
the lords to veto the Acts of the commons, than
the Court of Aldermen was deprived of a similar
right over the proceedings of the Common Council.</p>

and the question was referred to a committee.<a id="noteref_933" name="noteref_933" href="#note_933"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">933</span></span></a> No

members who came to him on the matter had
refused to acquaint him with the reasons for which
it was to be summoned, and he moved that the
subscribers to the request for a court should state
why the court was summoned before any other
business was taken in hand. This proposal met with
great opposition, and a debate arose on the question
whether the mayor's motion should take precedence
of the reading of the minutes of the last court or not,
and lasted until nine o'clock at night. At length the
mayor's motion was negatived and the minutes of the
last court were read. It then became known that the
reason for the court being summoned was to hear a
committee's report read. But the mayor at this point
declared himself tired with sitting so long and rose to
go, promising to call a court the next morning or
any time most convenient. Upon certain members
insisting upon the report being read then and there,
his lordship and all the aldermen except one left the
court. Nevertheless the report was read, and the
members themselves fixed a day for another court for
taking it into consideration unless the mayor himself
should summon one in the meantime. His lordship

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the Common Council had resolved
to administer to itself a further purge. A committee
was appointed (17 March, 1649) to "consider what
officers are properly to sitt in this courte as itt is a

and are to doe and performe service in the courte,

Another committee was appointed to enquire what
members of the council or others holding positions
under the council had subscribed engagements which
brought them within the purview of the ordinances
of parliament of the 18th and 20th December. It
was further instructed to devise some good expedient
"to heale upp all breaches and that may tende to
union and to the peace and safety of this citty, and
likewise for the begettinge of a right understandinge
and to keepe a good correspondency both betweene
the parliament and citty and betweene the army

Common Council resolved that in the opinion of the
court "such persons as were chosen to any places of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the continued presence of the soldiers
of Fairfax in the city was becoming more and more
burdensome. Scarcely a day passed without some

not surprising if, bearing in mind the horrors that the

a proposal (17 April) that the custody of the Tower

in preference to the city's own trained bands.<a id="noteref_948" name="noteref_948" href="#note_948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A series of royalist successes in Ireland now
engaged the attention of Cromwell, recently appointed
(15 March) lord-lieutenant of that country, but
nothing could be done without money. More than
a year ago (16 Feb., 1648) an ordinance had been
passed for raising money for Ireland, but in the city
it had been almost treated as a dead letter—"in
divers wards no assessment at all, and in most very
little paid in." The civic authorities had recently
(22 March, 1649) been reminded of their remissness<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in this respect by a letter from the Council of State,

could not be brought to execute it from a sense of
duty.<a id="noteref_949" name="noteref_949" href="#note_949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three weeks later (12 April) a deputation from
parliament, including Cromwell himself, appeared
before the Common Council and desired a loan of
£120,000 upon the security of the Act for assessment
of £90,000 per month and the Act for sale of fee-farm
rents. The security was not liked, nevertheless the
council nominated a committee to confer with parliament
as to the best means of raising the money.<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href="#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Want of money was not the only difficulty that
Cromwell had to contend with. The levelling spirit
which two years before had displayed itself in the ranks
of the army, and had ever since been fostered by
speeches and writings of the wrong-headed and
impracticable John Lilburne, again asserted itself.
The troops refused to serve in Ireland. A mutiny
broke out at "The Bull," in Bishopsgate Street, the
soldiers refusing to obey their colonel's orders and
seizing the regimental colours. An example had to
be made, so one of the ringleaders was shot in St.
Paul's Churchyard. Five others condemned to death
were pardoned. The funeral of the unfortunate man
who was executed was made the occasion of a public
demonstration against parliament and the army,<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href="#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> and
for some time afterwards the Levellers continued to
give trouble in different parts of the country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time was passing rapidly and yet the establishment

wrote the secretary of the French ambassador in
England to Cardinal Mazarin, "that this act should
be effected in the ordinary form of a simple publication,
without the mayor and aldermen being
supported by any soldiers, in order to show that no
violent means had been resorted to; but a crowd
of people having gathered around them with
hootings and insults, compelled them to send for
some troops, who first drove away all bystanders,
and thus they finished their publication."<a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a> A man

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two aldermen, Sir Thomas Soame and Richard
Chambers, who had absented themselves on the

(1 June) to answer for their conduct. Soame, who
was himself a member of the House, boldly declared<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the proclamation "was against several oaths
which he had taken as an alderman of London, and
against his judgment and conscience." Chambers
said in defence "that his heart did not go along in that
business." Both delinquents were adjudged to lose
their aldermanries, and Soame was also condemned
to lose his seat in the House.<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a> Whilst inflicting
punishment upon those who determined to remain
staunch to the royalist cause, the House resolved to
honour those who supported the new order of things,
and on the 6th June a proposal was made to authorise
the Speaker "to create the dignity of a knight,
and to confer the same upon Thomas Andrews,
alderman and lord mayor of London, and Isaac
Pennington and Thomas Atkins [Atkin], aldermen

The news of the success was despatched to the mayor

the soldiers had got to the end of their pay and

and if you suffer free quarter to come upon you it
may produce great inconvenience. You are therefore
to take it into serious consideration, and you

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 25th August Glyn, the city's Recorder,
yielded to pressure and resigned his office. An
attempt had been made in January, 1648, to get him
to resign in favour of William Steele, but he managed
to keep his place notwithstanding his being a prisoner
and threatened with impeachment at the time. On
the 9th August, 1649, the Court of Aldermen desired
him to surrender his place on the ground that both
law and the custom of the city demanded that the
Recorder of the city should be an apprentice of the
law and not a sergeant-at-law.<a id="noteref_969" name="noteref_969" href="#note_969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">969</span></span></a> The plea was a

a slur upon his profession. This answer he made on

had thought better of it, and came into court and
there "freely tendred" his resignation, which was
accepted as "his own free voluntary act." The court

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Michaelmas-day, the day of election of a
fresh mayor, arrived Andrews was not re-elected, to
the disappointment of a large number of citizens, who
petitioned the Common Council to enquire into the
manner in which the elections had taken place. The
court, whilst declaring that the election had been
carried out according to custom, was willing to appoint
a committee to search the City's Records with the view
of getting more definite information as to the mode
of such election, as well as to enquire into charges that
had been publicly made against Sir John Wollaston in
connection with the recent election. Andrews himself
appears to have suffered no little disappointment, if
we may judge from his not presiding at any Common
Council or Court of Aldermen after the 9th October,
leaving that duty to Foote, the lord mayor elect, as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days before Andrews quitted the mayoralty
the Guildhall was the scene of one of those trials for
which it is historically famous. On the 24th October<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(1649) John Lilburne was brought to trial for spreading
seditious pamphlets. Parliament had shown every
disposition to conciliate this impracticable reformer,
but all its efforts had been futile. "Tell your masters
from me," said he to a friend who visited him in the
Tower, "that if it were possible for me now to choose,
I had rather choose to live seven years under old
King Charles's government (notwithstanding their
beheading him as a tyrant for it) when it was at the
worst before this parliament, than live one year
under their present government that now rule; nay,
let me tell you, if they go on with that tyranny they
are in, they will make Prince Charles have friends
enow not only to cry him up, but also really to fight
for him to bring him into his father's throne."<a id="noteref_972" name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a>
His trial was at length forced on parliament by the
injudicious publication of a pamphlet<a id="noteref_973" name="noteref_973" href="#note_973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">973</span></span></a> calculated to
excite discontent in the army, and a mutiny broke
out in the garrison at Oxford so soon after the issue
of this pamphlet that it was justly thought to have
occasioned the outbreak. The country became flooded
with seditious pamphlets to such an extent that an
Act was passed for their suppression and for the
better regulation of printing. The civic authorities
and the Stationers' Company were especially admonished
to see the provisions of the Act carried
out.<a id="noteref_974" name="noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">974</span></span></a> What brought matters to a climax was the
discovery that the Levellers were entering upon<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
negotiations with Prince Charles, and thereupon the
House resolved (11 Sept.) that Lilburne's trial should
at once be proceeded with.<a id="noteref_975" name="noteref_975" href="#note_975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">975</span></span></a> A special commission of
Oyer and Terminer, presided over by Andrews, the outgoing
Lord Mayor, and including the Recorder, the
Common Sergeant and nine aldermen, was opened at
the Guildhall on Wednesday, the 24th October. The
trial lasted three days. Lilburne made a spirited
defence, winding up with a solemn peroration in which
he invoked God Almighty to guide and direct the
jury "to do that which is just, and for His glory."
His words sent a thrill of enthusiasm through the
crowded hall, the audience with "an extraordinary
great hum" giving vent to cries of "Amen! Amen!"
in such a manner that Skippon, who was in attendance,
deemed it advisable to send for more troops in
case of disturbance. When in the end a verdict of
acquittal was brought in, a wild scene followed.
"The whole multitude in the hall, for joy of the
prisoner's acquittal, gave such a loud and unanimous
shout as is believed was never heard in Guildhall,
which lasted for about half an hour without intermission."
The judges turned pale from fear, but the
prisoner at the bar, so far from displaying any excess
of joy, remained unmoved and silent, and "rather
more sad in his countenance than he was before."<a id="noteref_976" name="noteref_976" href="#note_976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">976</span></span></a>
He was conducted back to the Tower, whence he had
been brought, amid the acclamations of the multitude.
At night bonfires were lighted in his honour. The
government made an attempt to detain him still in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prison, but in about a fortnight the general discontent
of the people and the intercession of friends procured
his liberation.</p>

Browne, had to go, notwithstanding his past services

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The late troubles had sadly depleted the city's
Chamber as well as increased the number of the poor
within the city's walls. It became necessary to
appoint a committee (18 Sept., 1649) to examine the
state of the city's finances. The result was that in the
following December the Common Council resolved to
cut down the table expenses of the mayor and sheriffs,
which were found to have materially increased since
they were last taken in hand in 1555.<a id="noteref_982" name="noteref_982" href="#note_982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">982</span></span></a> Thenceforth
it was to be unlawful for any mayor or sheriff to be
served at dinner with more than one course; nor
were they to have at any time "any more sundry
dishes of meat at that one course, to a mess of ten
or twelve persons, upon the Lord's day, Tuesday,
Thursday or any ordinary festival day, than seaven,
whether the same be hot or cold." One or two of
the dishes might (if they pleased) be brought to the
table hot "after the first five or six be served." On
Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday the course
was to comprise not more than five sundry dishes of
meat or six of fish, to be served in such order as they
pleased. <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Hors d'œuvres</span></span>, such as "brawne, callups

herings, shrimps," and dishes "serveinge onely for
settinge forth and furnisheinge the table at any
of the said dinners or feasts and not there to be cutt

dishes thus limited. Similar restrictions were placed
upon the diet of the members of the household of

was to "make any feast" on entering or leaving
office.<a id="noteref_983" name="noteref_983" href="#note_983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">983</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto the mayor and sheriffs for the time

the allowance made to them by the Common Council,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was another matter of municipal interest
which claimed the attention of the civic authorities
about this time. Ever since 1550, when, as we have
seen, the borough of Southwark first became completely
subject to the jurisdiction of the city, the inhabitants
of the borough had suffered from the anomalous position
of being ruled by an alderman not of their choosing,
and by a Common Council to which they sent no
representatives. Nevertheless, it was not until the
close of 1649 that they began to raise any serious
objection to the existing state of things.  On the 4th<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
December of that year they petitioned parliament
that they might be incorporated or enfranchised either
with or without the City, on the ground that, as matters
stood, their poor were neglected and they suffered
from "diversity of jurisdictions," under which they
were subjected to "double service and charges," such
as no other body suffered throughout the kingdom.<a id="noteref_997" name="noteref_997" href="#note_997"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">997</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in the following year (28 Jan., 1650) the
City presented a counter petition in defence of its
rights and privileges in Southwark, and the whole
matter was referred by parliament to the Committee
for Corporations.<a id="noteref_998" name="noteref_998" href="#note_998"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">998</span></span></a> The inhabitants of Southwark

effect, denied that the inconveniences mentioned by
the petitioners were caused by their being under the
City's government. As to the alleged grievance of
being subject to concurrent jurisdictions, that was
nothing uncommon. Not that the City itself countenanced
variety of jurisdiction over the borough.
Far from it. In fact, the civic authorities had recently
themselves applied to parliament for the removal of
the "Court Marshall" (or Marshalsea) and the abolition
of the "Marshall of the Upper Bench" from the
borough. The answer concluded by assuring the
Committee for Corporations that if any inconveniences
arose in the borough from any defect in the City's
government the City would be pleased to receive the
assistance of the inhabitants in asking the supreme
authority of parliament to amend it.  No defect,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
however, could justify the separation of the borough
from the City. There was another objection. The
incorporation of Southwark would not only be an
invasion of the City's rights, but would work injury to
the several companies and fraternities of the city which
for trade purposes had become incorporated. These
exercised their power of government over, and received
support from, their members who were not exclusively
inhabitants of the city, but dwellers in the suburbs
two or three miles away. A conference was proposed
between the parties,<a id="noteref_1000" name="noteref_1000" href="#note_1000"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1000</span></span></a> but nothing appears to have
come of it, and the matter was allowed to rest for
another hundred years and more.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cromwell had not been long in Ireland before the
country began to assume at least a semblance of prosperity.
The good achieved by the city of London and
the companies in Ulster in the earlier years of the
plantation had well nigh disappeared during the
troublous times of the civil war. Londonderry itself
had suffered two sieges at the hands of the royalists,
but the garrison on both occasions had displayed the
same indomitable courage as that which in later years
made them famous in the pages of history, and with
like success. Cruel as was Cromwell's policy in
Ireland it accomplished its object. By February,
1650, Bradshaw was able to write to the mayor of
London<a id="noteref_1001" name="noteref_1001" href="#note_1001"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1001</span></span></a> informing him of the intention of the
Council of State to "plant" the seaports in Ulster,
which had by God's blessing been reduced to obedience.
He understood that the City had or "pretended<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to have" some interest in the towns of Londonderry
and Coleraine, with other lands and fishings in Ulster,
and he desired to know if the City intended to vindicate
its right or claim. If so, the lord mayor was advised
to depute someone to attend the committee appointed
by the Council of State for Irish affairs and explain
to him the nature of the City's rights. This letter
having been read to the Court of Aldermen on the
19th February, counsel was instructed to investigate
the City's interest in Ireland.<a id="noteref_1002" name="noteref_1002" href="#note_1002"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1002</span></span></a> A committee of
aldermen was subsequently appointed to confer with
representatives of the several livery companies on the
matter. Although Bradshaw's letter had desired a
speedy reply, it was not until the 9th May that a
report was submitted to the Court of Aldermen.
This report, which had received the assent of the
companies, recommended that counsel should forthwith
be instructed to assert the rights of the City
and the companies to the towns and lands originally
conveyed by letters patents of the 30th March, 1613,
to the Irish Society.<a id="noteref_1003" name="noteref_1003" href="#note_1003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1003</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Cromwell returned to England at the end
of May (1650), having all but stamped out the rebellion
in Ireland, he was met at Hounslow Heath by a huge
concourse of people, including many members of
parliament and the chief officers of the army. At
Hyde Park, where it is said that the lord mayor and
the militia awaited him, although no directions to that
effect appear in the City's Records, he was received
with a volley of artillery.<a id="noteref_1004" name="noteref_1004" href="#note_1004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1004</span></span></a> He had returned at the

in Scotland. No time was lost. On Wednesday, the
26th June, an Act was passed constituting him
"commander-in-chief of all the forces raised or to be
raised by the authority of parliament within the
Commonwealth of England,"<a id="noteref_1005" name="noteref_1005" href="#note_1005"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1005</span></span></a> in place of Fairfax,
and on the following Saturday he set out for the North.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days before parliament thus transferred the
command of the army from Fairfax to Cromwell,
Charles II had landed in Scotland and Fairfax had
displayed some scruples in opposing the Scots, who,
as he declared, had a right to choose their own form
of government. Not so Cromwell. He saw the
danger that was likely to arise from such a concession,
and he resolved forthwith to make an attempt on
Edinburgh. He was, however, out-manœuvred by
Leslie and forced to fall back upon Dunbar. There he
was fortunate enough to utterly rout the Scottish
forces (3 Sept.) by one of those dashing cavalry
charges for which his "Ironsides" were famous.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This victory, which contributed more perhaps than
anything else to establish the Commonwealth, was
celebrated in the city by a public thanksgiving. A
"convenient dinner" was ordered by the Common
Council (12 Sept.) to be provided for that day, to which
Major-General Harrison, Major-General Skippon, the
lieutenant of the Tower, and others were to be
invited. The City's latest acquisition, the New Park
at Richmond, was laid under contribution for venison.
The dinner was not on this occasion paid for out of
the City's cash, owing probably to the low condition
of the Chamber, but was defrayed by the payment of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ten shillings by each alderman and five shillings by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the kingly office as forming part of the
Constitution had been declared by parliament to be
abolished immediately after the execution of Charles,
emblems of royalty might still be seen displayed in
the city and elsewhere many months afterwards. On
the western façade of St. Paul's, for example, there
remained statues of James and of Charles. These
the Court of Aldermen had been ordered to remove
(31 July, 1650). They were further ordered to see that
the head of Charles's statue at the Royal Exchange
was struck off, the sceptre in the effigy's hand broken,
and an inscription set up hard by proclaiming the
abolition of tyranny—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Exit Tyrannus Regum Ultimus</span></span>—and
the dawn of liberty. On the 14th August the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

were many places, many churches and companies'

of the late king had been allowed still to remain, and

the nation at the least possible charge, and declaring
their willingness to bear their share in defraying
expenses with the rest of the nation, the petitioners
prayed for a more equitable amount of taxation
than that which they had hitherto been called upon
to bear. The reasons they gave were (1) the losses
which merchants had sustained within the last few
years by the interruption of foreign trade, vessels
belonging to citizens of London having been constantly
seized by Prince Rupert and others who roamed the
seas for piratical purposes, and (2) the withdrawal
of the wealthier class of citizens to the suburbs of
London, where houses were increasing, and where
taxation was less than in the city.</p>

to the Council of State to raise out of the militias
of the several counties a force of horse and dragoons
not exceeding the number of 3,000 horse and 1,000
dragoons. The civic authorities lost no time in
representing to parliament that the City had always
been exempt from the charge of providing horse.
They were ready, however, to bear their proportion
of the necessary charge with the rest of the kingdom.<a id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href="#note_1022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a>
Later on they became more complaisant, and expressed
their readiness to furnish the number of horse
demanded "in respect of the pressing occasions and
necessities now lying on the Commonwealth," notwithstanding
the proportion laid on the City was
greater than that imposed on any other part of the
nation. It was stipulated that the City's assent was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not to be drawn into a precedent for the future.<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href="#note_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a> The
Council of State, on the other hand, would not for
a moment allow that the City had been called upon
to contribute more than its just proportion. London
was a large place, they said, where many opportunities
arose for outbreaks, and where there was
not always a force at hand to put them down. They
doubted not there were many well-affected persons
within London, Westminster, the Hamlets and Southwark,
able and willing to lend their horses, with well-affected
riders, for the prevention of mischief, and
they recommended that such should be encouraged.<a id="noteref_1024" name="noteref_1024" href="#note_1024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ever since the passing of the Act of Parliament
of the 28th February, 1649, the relations between the
court of Aldermen, including the lord mayor for the
time being, and the court of Common Council had
become more and more strained. It had become a
common practice whenever the Common Council
made a proposition distasteful to the mayor and
aldermen for his lordship and such aldermen as
happened to be present to break up the court by
taking their departure. Mention has already been
made of two occasions (viz., 13 Jan., 1649, and
14 June, 1650) on which the mayor and aldermen
took this method of expressing their dissatisfaction
with the Common Council. They took the same

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In February of the next year (1652) the question
of allowances to be made to the mayor and sheriffs
was referred to another committee, with the result
that in the following June the court voted an
allowance to lord mayor Kendricke of £1,500, the
same to be reduced by £100 for succeeding lord
mayors, and an allowance of £600 to each of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

matter, however, was by no means settled. On the

of perquisites, and resolved "that the succeeding lord
mayors and sheriffs of this city shall have allowances

to have been guilty of various misdemeanours,

As soon as this sudden movement became known

meagre at this period, yielding us but scanty information
on matters which must have deeply affected the
citizens in general. From other sources, however,
we learn that three regiments of volunteers were
formed in London and its suburbs for the special
purpose of serving as a guard to parliament. The
powers of the Committee for the Militia of the
City were enlarged, and the number of members
increased by fifteen individuals, among whom was
Lieutenant-Colonel John Fenton, who had been
removed from the Common Council by order of
parliament. The militia throughout the country was
called out, and a month's pay ordered to be advanced
by "each person who finds horsemen or footmen,"
the same to be repaid by assessments authorised by<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
parliament. Anyone joining the Scottish army or
inducing others to join, anyone found with papers or
declarations of the Scottish king in his hands, or discovered
inciting to a breach of the peace, was declared
to be a traitor, and as such would be executed.
Within the late lines of communication strict supervision
was to be kept over all houses. Lodgers'
names were to be taken and registered; servants and
children were to be allowed out of doors only at
certain hours. The execution of these and similar
orders was entrusted to the lord mayor and the rest
of the Committee for the Militia of the City in conjunction
with the Commissioners for the Militia of
Westminster, the Hamlets and Southwark, who were
required to meet and sit daily for the purpose. A
troop of horse was to be forthwith despatched to
meet the invaders, the men to be mounted on horses
lately seized in London and its neighbourhood, the
proprietors of which were to receive tickets for
payment of their value in case any of them should be
"lost or spoiled."<a id="noteref_1054" name="noteref_1054" href="#note_1054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1054</span></span></a></p>

Charles, addressed "to our trusty and well-beloved

character of the letter was such that the House

Fields. Among those conveyed to the Tower were
the Earls of Cleveland and Lauderdale. As they
passed along Cornhill in their coaches, with a guard
of horse, the Earl of Lauderdale was addressed by
a by-stander—"Oh, my lord, you are welcome to

the gallantry of the officers and soldiers he was full

(Oct., 1651) found little favour with the merchants

city<a id="noteref_1064" name="noteref_1064" href="#note_1064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1064</span></span></a> asking that certain brass guns laid up at Gresham
College and other places in the city should be forthwith
delivered to the ordnance officer, as the guns
formerly used in the fleet during the late wars had
been dispersed among various garrisons. By way of
postscript—as if an afterthought—the council added:
"As there is a pretension of right made to such guns
on behalf of the city we shall be ready to receive
and consider any claim which they shall make to
them; and if it appear that they belong to the city
we will take care, after the service is past to which<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they are designed, that they are either restored or
satisfaction made according to their value." In May
it was found that the store of gunpowder in the Tower
was likely to run short owing to a breach of contract,
and again application for assistance was made to the
City, who were asked to lend such gunpowder as lay
in the Companies' halls.<a id="noteref_1065" name="noteref_1065" href="#note_1065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1065</span></span></a> In March of the following

By that time a victory had been gained over the
Dutch admirals Tromp and De Ruyter off Portland
(18 Feb., 1653) by Blake and Monk, the latter
having for a time exchanged land service for the
sea. This success was the more welcome inasmuch
as Blake had previously suffered a signal defeat
(28 Nov., 1652) at the hands of the Dutch admirals
and had himself been wounded. Moreover Tromp
had been so elated at his victory that in bravado he
had fixed a broom to his masthead, in token of his
resolution to sweep the sea of English vessels.</p>

and old linen, for relief of the wounded soldiers and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mariners which God hath made instrumental in the

Fowke intimated that it was the express wish of many
of the contributors that the widows and children of
those that had been killed should share in the charity.
To this the court agreed.<a id="noteref_1068" name="noteref_1068" href="#note_1068"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1068</span></span></a> The money was despatched

this success a general thanksgiving at St. Paul's was

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few weeks before the Long Parliament was so
rudely "interrupted" by Cromwell (20 April, 1653)
it raised the ire of the Common Council of the city by
the action of its commissioners, sitting at Haberdashers'
Hall, who had prosecuted and fined certain
inhabitants of the ward of Farringdon Within for
having contravened the Act touching election of
officers upon the Treasonable Engagement.<a id="noteref_1071" name="noteref_1071" href="#note_1071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1071</span></span></a> A deputation
from the court was ordered to wait upon the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
commissioners and to get some explanation of their
conduct and to report the result of their interview.
The commissioners assumed a very haughty tone.
They were, they said, entrusted with full powers to
deal with such matters by parliament, but expressed
their intention to "be tender to passe severe sentence
upon any well affected citizen. For that they have
power to doe it or not to doe it." This was not at
all to the mind of the Common Council, who thereupon
resolved (4 March, 1653) to ask parliament to
explain who were promoters and abettors of the
Treasonable Engagement, and whether the citizens
were to be considered as promoters and abettors for
having obeyed the orders of the militia authorised by
parliament in manning forts and appearing in arms,
as they so often had done, in defence of parliament
as well as of themselves.<a id="noteref_1072" name="noteref_1072" href="#note_1072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1072</span></span></a> Before any answer was

very different character.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This parliament, like its predecessor, was of short
duration, lasting little more than five months. One
other parliament and no more was summoned by
Cromwell (17 Sept., 1656). It was before this parliament
that Alderman Sir Christopher Pack (the only
member for the city, so far as we have any authentic
record), brought forward (23 Feb., 1657) his famous
"remonstrance," desiring the Protector to assume the
kingly dignity and to restore the House of Lords.
The question whether the "remonstrance" should be
read was answered in the affirmative by a majority of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nearly 100 after some hours' debate.<a id="noteref_1082" name="noteref_1082" href="#note_1082"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1082</span></span></a> Before it was

the army, and Colonel Pride had no difficulty in
obtaining a large number of signatures against it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After many days' debate, in the course of which
the title of the "remonstrance" was changed to that
of "petition and advice,"<a id="noteref_1084" name="noteref_1084" href="#note_1084"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1084</span></span></a> the document received the
assent of the Commons, and on the 31st March a copy
of it engrossed on vellum was presented to the
Protector at Whitehall in the presence of the whole
House. Its main feature was the creation of a second
House, the members of which were to enjoy their
seats for life and exercise some of the functions of the
former House of Lords. Cromwell was asked to
assume the title of king with the right of naming his
own successor. The kingship after considerable
hesitation he declined (8 May): "I cannot undertake
this government with the title of king. And that
is mine answer to this great and weighty business."<a id="noteref_1085" name="noteref_1085" href="#note_1085"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1085</span></span></a>
The rest of the terms he accepted, and on the 28th

of state.<a id="noteref_1086" name="noteref_1086" href="#note_1086"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1086</span></span></a> On the 1st July public proclamation was

be, presented in the following year a silver bason

him with a banquet at which special dishes, we read,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Friday, the 12th March (1658), the civic
authorities were sent for to Whitehall, where they
were informed by Cromwell that Charles meditated
an invasion, and that Ormond had recently been<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
engaged in enlisting support for the royalist cause in

city into a state of readiness for the suppression of
tumult and disorder if any should arise, and to place
the militia in trustworthy hands.<a id="noteref_1090" name="noteref_1090" href="#note_1090"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1090</span></span></a> The warning came
just in time, for the Common Council had that very

guns and other war material stored at Gresham
College, the Leadenhall and in the Guildhall Chapel,
and for the proceeds to be paid into the Chamber.<a id="noteref_1091" name="noteref_1091" href="#note_1091"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1091</span></span></a>
On the 15th the Common Council appointed a

document was presented to the court for approval,
and on the following day carried by a deputation to
Cromwell. Its terms were very flattering. After
alluding to the blessings which had accompanied the
Protector's government and the recent news that
"the old restless enemy" was preparing to execute
his wrath against God, his highness and the nation,
the citizens concluded by assuring him that his

September—his "fortunate day," as he called it—the
day of Dunbar and of Worcester. The lord mayor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless, when the danger was over the
House thought fit to run the risk of alienating the
favour of the City by an attempt to force the re-election
of John Ireton as mayor for the coming year
upon the unwilling citizens. On the 2nd September
the House resolved that "John Ireton" [thus ignoring
his knighthood], then lord mayor of the city of
London, should continue to execute the office of
lord mayor for the year ensuing, and ordered "that it
be recommended to the city of London to see the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

government of the city was shown to depend upon
"two strong supports," viz., the customs of the city
and its charters, confirmed as they had been by
divers Acts of Parliament; that by virtue of these
charters and customs the mayor was chosen by the
citizens, that he remained in office for no more than
one year, and was presented to the supreme power of
the nation for approbation. The petition went on to
remind the House how on various occasions, and
notably on the 13th January, 1644, and the 6th and
18th May of the same year, parliament had formally
acknowledged the constant affection and assistance it
had received from the city, and concluded by praying
the House to lay no restraint upon the free election
of their mayor by the citizens nor infringe the ancient
customs and charters of the city, a breach of which
"would exceedingly hazard, if not totally destroy, the
peace, good order and happiness of the most ancient
and well governed city" in the nation, if not in the
whole world.</p>

arrived at, the Common Council resolved to ask the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On that day week (13th October) the House
suffered another indignity at the hands of the army.
No sooner had Lambert defeated the royalist insurgents
in Cheshire than he and his fellow officers
made extraordinary demands of parliament. When
these were refused they betook themselves to brute
force and sent troops to shut out members from the
House.<a id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111" href="#note_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a> So arbitrary a proceeding was distasteful to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When lord mayor's day came round and Thomas
Aleyne was to enter upon his year of office there was
some apprehension in the minds of Fleetwood and the
Council of Officers, who were now supreme, lest the
day should be made an opportunity for display of
popular feeling in favour of parliament. It was
suggested, therefore, to the Court of Aldermen by
Fleetwood that it might be well to omit the usual<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shows and attendance of the companies on that day.
The court, however, thought otherwise, and directed
a deputation to wait upon his excellency and acquaint
him with the preparations that had already been
made, and with the disappointment which the citizens
would feel if they had to forego the customary
solemnities, which could be carried out, in the
opinion of the court, without any risk of disturbance.<a id="noteref_1112" name="noteref_1112" href="#note_1112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1112</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Monk, who was in Scotland, disapproved of the
action of Lambert and his fellow officers, and prepared
to march southward for the purpose (he said) of
vindicating the rights of parliament. Whether he
had any ulterior motive in view at the time is not
known. Every effort was made by the officers of
Lambert's army to secure the support of the City
before Monk's arrival. On the 4th November and
again on the 8th, Fleetwood, Whitelock and others
conferred with the civic authorities. On the latter
occasion Whitelock did not hesitate to declare that
Monk's real design was the king's restoration at the
risk of a civil war. "I shewed the danger of it to the
city and nation and counselled them to provide for
their own safety, and to join for the safety of the
whole nation and for preservation of the peace."
The Common Council expressed their thanks, and
resolved to follow the advice thus given.<a id="noteref_1113" name="noteref_1113" href="#note_1113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1113</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst matters were yet in a state of suspense
the apprentices of the city again took the lead and
presented (5 Dec.) a petition to the Common Council
on the subject of "how the peace of this city may be
preserved." Their petition was referred to a committee
for consideration,<a id="noteref_1116" name="noteref_1116" href="#note_1116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1116</span></span></a> but the apprentices brooked no
delay. Out into the street they ran, in spite of all
precautions to keep them indoors, crying out for a "free
parliament." Amid the confusion Hewson appeared
on the scene with a regiment of soldiers, and there
was some little bloodshed, two men being killed. This
brought the army into greater disrepute than ever,
and the cry became general that "it was only kept
on foot for the murder of citizens." The next day
(6 Dec.) the Court of Aldermen sent a deputation to
the Committee of Safety to excuse the recent outbreak
and to disavow any complicity in it.<a id="noteref_1117" name="noteref_1117" href="#note_1117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1117</span></span></a> The Committee
desired to know particulars as to how the men came
by their death, and to understand how far the Court
of Aldermen would be responsible for the peace of the
city. The Committee was told in reply that the recent
deaths were under the consideration of the coroner,
and that as to the steps about to be taken for the
preservation of the peace of the city, further information
would shortly be given.<a id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118" href="#note_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 8th December a Court of Aldermen sat
and appointed a committee to confer with Fleetwood
for preserving the peace and safety of the city and
"for a right understanding between the city and
army." He was to be desired in the meantime to
keep his soldiers within barracks whilst the court of
Common Council was sitting, unless the mayor or
sheriffs expressed a wish to the contrary, and to cause
the removal of certain "granadoes" recently stored
at Gresham College and elsewhere in the city,
which had caused strange apprehensions among the
inhabitants. A petition to the Common Council for
a parliament as in 1642 was unfavourably received,
and handed back to the petitioners with a request to
them not to print it.<a id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119" href="#note_1119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1119</span></span></a> Anxious as the citizens were
to get rid of the army's ammunition stored in the city,
they were not so anxious to part with their own little
stock of gunpowder, and hesitated to lodge it in the
Tower as requested, lest it should be some day used
against themselves. The City Remembrancer was
instructed (17 Dec.) to see Fleetwood on the matter,
and to represent to him the feeling of the inhabitants,
that order might be taken for securing public peace
and quiet.<a id="noteref_1120" name="noteref_1120" href="#note_1120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1120</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the 19th matters were accommodated between
Fleetwood and the City. A parliament was to be
summoned which should be free from military influence
or interference. The Common Council, on hearing
of the success of the committee appointed to confer
with Fleetwood, were so satisfied with the manner in
which it had carried out its duties that they authorised<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it to continue to confer with his lordship from time
to time as it should see cause for prevention of all
misunderstandings between the city and the army.<a id="noteref_1121" name="noteref_1121" href="#note_1121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1121</span></span></a>
The action of the mayor, the common council and
the committee in the matter was much canvassed,
however, by a certain section of the community, and
they were accused of betraying the rights and liberties
of the city. A "declaration" was therefore drawn
up in vindication of their conduct.<a id="noteref_1122" name="noteref_1122" href="#note_1122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 22nd a fresh committee was appointed to
consult for the peace and safety of the city as well as
to consider what answers should be sent to Monk,
to the officers at Portsmouth and to Lawson, who
was in command of a squadron in the Thames, all of
whom were opposed to the army in London and in
favour of a parliament.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No time was lost; on the following day (23 Dec.)
the committee reported to the Common Council recommending,
among other things, that six regiments of
trained bands should be at once called out and placed
under the command of officers, whose commissions
should be under the common seal of the city; that
commissioners should be appointed to confer with
Haslerigg, Morley, Walton and Vice-Admiral Lawson
touching the safety of the city and the peace and
settlement of the nation, and "in due time" to give
an answer to General Monk's letter; and that the
commissioners should be authorised to propound the
convening of a free parliament according to the
late "declaration" of the court. These recommendations
being approved, commissioners were there<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day (Saturday, 24 Dec.) the Common
Council was busy nominating officers of the trained
bands. It also ordered the city's chains and posts to
be set up in the several precincts, and the gates, portcullises
and posterns to be looked to; but the council
afterwards changed their minds on this matter, and
the order was countermanded before the court rose.<a id="noteref_1124" name="noteref_1124" href="#note_1124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1124</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revival of the city's militia was a welcome
sign to the royalists. "What does the city?" wrote
secretary Nicholas from Brussels about this time.
"We know they talk of setting up a militia of their
own, and that some of them say, as they helped to
drive out the father, they will help to bring in the
son."<a id="noteref_1125" name="noteref_1125" href="#note_1125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1125</span></span></a> And again, a few days later, "The city should
be made to understand how much their interests are
concerned to suppress the illegal and boundless
authority usurped by the army which cannot be
done but by force, and by no force so well as that
of the city and counties adjacent; for if the army
shall ... get again to be absolute masters in
London, no citizen or inhabitant there will be secure
of anything they possess longer than it pleases the
soldiery, which will soon make the citizens their
absolute slaves." Once more, "The city cannot be
secure," he repeats, "if the army continue their
quarter and soldiers still among them, nor can any<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
parliament be free whilst awed by an army....
Until it [the army] shall be made to obey orders

or peace, either in city or country."<a id="noteref_1126" name="noteref_1126" href="#note_1126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1126</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spirit that had moved Haslerigg, Morley,
Walton and Lawson at length moved the rank and
file of the army in London. The soldiers placed
themselves at the command of their cashiered officers.
On the 24th December they marched to Lenthall's
house in Chancery Lane, expressed their sorrow for
the past, and promised to stand by parliament for the
future. On the 26th the Rump was for the second
time restored to power.<a id="noteref_1127" name="noteref_1127" href="#note_1127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1127</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens had obtained their desire to have
once more a parliament, but the parliament they got
was far from being the free parliament they had been
looking for. They wished to take an early opportunity—lest
their action should be misinterpreted—to
inform the Rump that the measures they had taken
for "settling" the trained bands had been taken before
"their honors came together this last time." They
desired to explain the reasons for undertaking the
work, and to show that in so doing the city had only
acted within its rights. A petition was accordingly
drawn up on the 28th December, setting forth that
disorders in the city had increased "by the exorbitant
actings of many of those men who at first being
appointed by parliament a Committee of Militia
within the city of London for their security and
safety, have since their last interruption acted by a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
commission under the Great Seal of England against
the same parliament," and that for the prevention
of any disorder that might arise they had fallen back
upon their ancient rights and usages, and had put
themselves in a posture of defence, not for the purpose
of acting against parliament, but for it. Whilst offering
these explanations the City was anxious that parliament
would receive into its House all such members as
were still alive and fill up the places of all who were
dead. On the 29th the Common Council resolved
that this petition should not be laid before the House
until further order.<a id="noteref_1128" name="noteref_1128" href="#note_1128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1128</span></span></a> The commissioners appointed
by the City to confer with Haslerigg, Morley and
Walton at Portsmouth had returned, and their report
made to the Common Council on that day may have
given rise to the postponement.</p>

others, waited upon the Court of Aldermen to confer
with them about the safety of the city. The erection
of the city posts and chains, which apparently had
been proceeded with, and the calling out of the
trained bands troubled parliament. By the 2nd
January Haslerigg was able to satisfy parliament on
the first head. It was contrary (he said) to the mind
of the lord mayor, aldermen and Common Council to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the Common Council ordered the settlement of the

a committee to lay before parliament the grounds and
reasons for so doing, the committee being instructed
to again press for a full and free parliament.<a id="noteref_1131" name="noteref_1131" href="#note_1131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1131</span></span></a> The
attitude of the City towards the restored Rump was
keenly watched by royalists abroad. "Let me know
certainly the Londoners' intentions about the Rump,"
wrote secretary Nicholas, "and settling their own
militia, and also the proceedings of Monk and
Lambert, and how each of them approves the
restoring of the Rump."<a id="noteref_1132" name="noteref_1132" href="#note_1132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1132</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City's anxiety for a return of a full and free
parliament in the place of the Rump was occasioned
in some degree by the fact that in the existing House
they had but a single representative, viz., Alderman
Atkin, and without due representation the citizens
refused to be subjected to taxation. "They were
resolved," Pepys notes in his diary (13 Jan.), "to
make no more applications to the parliament, nor to
pay any money, unless the secluded members be
brought in or a free parliament chosen."</p>

well on their way to London. On the 6th January<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he had despatched a letter<a id="noteref_1133" name="noteref_1133" href="#note_1133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1133</span></span></a> to the Common Council

Alderman Fowke and two other commissioners were
ordered (19 Jan.) to go out to meet him and thank
him for his second letter, and for his cheerful
concurrence with the declaration of the Common
Council, and to desire the continuance of a good
understanding between his excellency and the court
for the settlement of the nation and peace of the
city. By the 30th they had returned and were able

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to avoid as much as possible the appearance
of entering London as a conqueror, Monk brought
with him no more than 5,000 men, a force considerably
less than that which was quartered in London and
Westminster. Having reached St. Albans, he wrote
to the Speaker asking that five of the regiments in
the capital might be removed to a distance before his
arrival lest his troops should become disaffected by
intercourse with those who had been so recently
engaged in rebellion. The House acquiesced and gave
orders to that effect, but the soldiers refused to leave
their quarters, swearing that they would not go
without their money, and threatening if their pay was
not received to "go where they might have it, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

hastily raised to satisfy their demands, they consented
to march out, and the next morning (3 Feb.) Monk
entered at the head of his force—"in very good plight
and stout officers"—and proceeded to the quarters
assigned to him at Whitehall recently occupied by
Bradshaw.<a id="noteref_1137" name="noteref_1137" href="#note_1137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1137</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Monk was anxious to feel the pulse of the City
before committing himself to any definite policy. He
had not long to wait before he was assured of its
favour. On the 8th February the Common Council
agreed to send a deputation to the general to
congratulate him upon his coming to London and to
thank him for his courtesy to the City's commissioners
recently despatched to him, as well as to express a
hope that the good understanding which had prevailed
between his excellency and the City might continue.<a id="noteref_1138" name="noteref_1138" href="#note_1138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1138</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The friendly attitude of the City towards Monk,
and its recent hostile attitude towards parliament—some
of the Common Council, we are told, had been
"very high" at the last court, and refused to pay
taxes until the House should be filled up<a id="noteref_1139" name="noteref_1139" href="#note_1139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1139</span></span></a>—was so
marked that the Rump determined upon dissolving
the Common Council, although it commended the
"discreet carriage" of the lord mayor in conducting
the business of the court.<a id="noteref_1140" name="noteref_1140" href="#note_1140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1140</span></span></a> Not content with this<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the House went further, and ordered troops to be
quartered in the city "for reducing the city to the
obedience of the parliament." The city's gates and
portcullises, moreover, were to be removed, and
eleven citizens, including an alderman, were ordered
into custody.<a id="noteref_1141" name="noteref_1141" href="#note_1141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1141</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unenviable task of seeing these orders
executed was, by a clever stroke of policy, committed
to Monk himself. There was no alternative open to
him but to obey, and to carry out the orders of
parliament with as little friction to the citizens as
was possible. No sooner had he taken up his
residence in the city for this purpose than he was
asked by the mayor to delay removing the city's
gates until the matter should be communicated to the
Court of Aldermen.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em"><span style="font-size: 80%">Monk confers with the Court of Aldermen, 10 Feb.</span></p></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A special court having been summoned Monk
attended in person (10 Feb.) and informed the
members of the commands that had been laid upon
him by parliament touching the city's gates and
portcullises. Being told that the execution of such
commands would be "of very ill consequence both to
parliament and the city" the general could only
reply that the commands of the House were so
positive that he could only hold his hand on one
condition, and that was that the city should acknowledge
the Rump that so he might have ground for
writing to and mediating with the House. The
court was allowed to consider the matter whilst
Monk withdrew. Upon his return he was informed
that the Court of Aldermen could not speak on<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
behalf of the whole body of citizens, "and that the
Common Council being now disabled to meet, there
was none in capacity to do it." But, said his
excellency, the Court of Aldermen might declare
their own minds? Again Monk withdrew, only to
be told, however, on his return that the court was
of opinion that their doing so "would not at this time
be a service either to the parliament or city."<a id="noteref_1142" name="noteref_1142" href="#note_1142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1142</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day (11 Feb.) the Court of Aldermen
again met. Monk, too, was there. He had just
despatched a letter to the Speaker of the House
complaining of the invidious work he and his soldiers
had been set to do—a work which served only to
bring them into discredit with the city—and
peremptorily demanding that every seat in the
House should be filled up by the following Friday
(17 Feb.) as a preliminary to the calling together of
a new parliament. When the aldermen heard of this
letter they were delighted, and ready to accede to
anything Monk might suggest. He proposed quartering
troops in the city "for a few days." The aldermen
raised no objection, but asked his excellency to utilise
as far as possible the inns and public victualling houses,
"so as may be least offence to the citizens."<a id="noteref_1143" name="noteref_1143" href="#note_1143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1143</span></span></a> They
even displayed a readiness to give up their own houses
to the use of the general and his officers, and promised
that his soldiers should lack nothing.<a id="noteref_1144" name="noteref_1144" href="#note_1144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1144</span></span></a> On his quitting
the court such a shout was raised of "God bless your
excellency" as had been seldom heard. Bonfires
were lighted that evening from Cheapside to Temple
Bar, bells were set ringing, and rumps carried in mock<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
procession and solemnly roasted in token of the
approaching dissolution of parliament. So great was
the hospitality offered to the soldiers that most of
them got gloriously drunk.<a id="noteref_1145" name="noteref_1145" href="#note_1145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1145</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day being Sunday (12 Feb.) Monk,
whose wife had joined him in his lodgings in the city,
attended morning service at St. Paul's, and in the
afternoon went to a church in Broad Street, probably
that of St. Peter le Poor, in the neighbourhood of his
lodgings.<a id="noteref_1146" name="noteref_1146" href="#note_1146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1146</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Monday (13 Feb.) he held a conference with
the mayor and aldermen at Drapers' Hall, a stone's
throw from where he lived, with reference to the
peace and safety of the city. Alderman Atkin, a
member of parliament, was sent for to be informed of
"sundry matters of great danger to the city," of which
information had reached the ears of the Court of
Aldermen, and which he was to communicate to the
House. But particulars are not recorded.<a id="noteref_1147" name="noteref_1147" href="#note_1147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1147</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Council of State were far from being pleased
with Monk for taking up his quarters in the city, and
repeatedly urged him to leave the city for Whitehall,
where they could keep a better watch on his movements.
They particularly desired his company at
Whitehall on Tuesday morning for the purpose (they
said) of consulting him on matters relating to public
safety, and in order that they might have an opportunity
of communicating to him the recent proceedings
of parliament.<a id="noteref_1148" name="noteref_1148" href="#note_1148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1148</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Monk was in no hurry to quit the city. On Wednesday
(15 Feb.) he sent for Alderman Fowke to say
that he purposed marching out of the city with his
forces on the following afternoon, but that in so doing
he had no intention of receding from his promise to
secure the safety of the city. He would also endeavour
to bring about a right understanding between parliament
and the city. Fowke having reported this to
the Court of Aldermen there was great alarm, and a
deputation was despatched, with Fowke at its head,
to beg the general to let his soldiers remain in the
city "if it may consist with his trust." Word was
brought next day to the court that in the event of his
excellency quitting the city he would leave behind
two regiments for its safety, and that if the court
would give him the names of persons fit to be officers
he would endeavour to get two regiments of their
own appointed by parliament.<a id="noteref_1149" name="noteref_1149" href="#note_1149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1149</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of quitting the city Monk only changed
his quarters to the house of William Wale, alderman
of the ward of Farringdon Without, whither he caused
his goods to be removed from Whitehall, as to a more
or less permanent residence.<a id="noteref_1150" name="noteref_1150" href="#note_1150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1150</span></span></a> There he remained,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile parliament had been busy
completing the bill for the qualifications of electors
and candidates for the new parliament, and on the
day fixed (17 Feb.) by Monk writs were ready to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be issued. According to the qualifications passed by
the House, no one could be elected a member of the
forthcoming parliament unless pledged to support a
republican form of government. As this meant the
exclusion of the members shut out by Pride's Purge in
1648 it gave rise to much dissatisfaction, and Monk
was appealed to. A deputation of the sitting members
met a deputation of the excluded members at Monk's
new quarters, when it was decided that the Presbyterian
members shut out by Pride's Purge should
again be allowed to take their seats. Four days later
(21 Feb.) they attended parliament at Monk's invitation
and were admitted without opposition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day passed off without any disturbance,
although it was feared that the "secluded" members
might attempt to force their way into parliament. It
was also feared that if such an attempt were made it
would be backed up by some inhabitants of the
city. The council had therefore asked Monk to
take precautions for securing the freedom of parliament
as well as maintaining peace within the city.<a id="noteref_1152" name="noteref_1152" href="#note_1152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1152</span></span></a></p>

thanksgiving—Monk was invited to an entertainment
at Grocers' Hall in honour of the restoration of a full

but party spirit was so rife that it became necessary
to warn the general against receiving anything that he
might hear "as the sense of the city."<a id="noteref_1155" name="noteref_1155" href="#note_1155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1155</span></span></a> Bonfires were

(22 Feb.) it received a deputation from the restored
House asking for a loan. With little hesitation the
court voted a sum of £60,000 on the security of the

deputies and common councilmen of the wards to
raise the money by subscription, and they were
further instructed to take the best course they could
for raising a sum of £100,000 upon the same account.<a id="noteref_1157" name="noteref_1157" href="#note_1157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1157</span></span></a>
It was subsequently (1 March) arranged that the sum

not be fully collected out of the assessment, the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having settled the militia of the kingdom as well
as that of London, parliament—the Long Parliament,
which during its actual or nominal existence for nearly
twenty years had experienced every vicissitude of
fortune—was at length dissolved (16 March) by its
own act, and writs were issued for a fresh parliament
to meet on the 25th April.<a id="noteref_1162" name="noteref_1162" href="#note_1162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1162</span></span></a> The new parliament was
known as the Convention Parliament on account of its
members having been elected without the king's writs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ten days after the dissolution of the Long
Parliament there came to the Common Council of the
city a deputation from the Council of State, in whose
hands the sole government of the kingdom then lay,
with a proposal to borrow the sum of half a million of
money (£500,000) upon the security of a moiety of the
excise. The court, after deliberation, agreed (2 April)
to lend a sum of money (amount not specified) to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Council of State upon security of the moiety of
the excise "and the honour of the said Council of
State," and ordered that subscriptions should at once
be set on foot in the several wards.<a id="noteref_1163" name="noteref_1163" href="#note_1163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1163</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scarcely had the House broken up before people
began to talk freely of the king and his probable
restoration, a subject on which they had hitherto
dared only to speak in a whisper. So bold indeed did
they become that on the very day of the dissolution
a man came with a ladder to the Exchange—not
"Royal," but "Great" Exchange—in the city and
obliterated with a brush the inscription, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Exit Tyrannus
Regum Ultimus</span></span>, which had been set up in August,
1650, near the site of the late king's statue, destroyed
by order of the then Council of State, as already
narrated. Before the end of the month another
statue was in course of making to take the place
of the one that had been thus destroyed.<a id="noteref_1164" name="noteref_1164" href="#note_1164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1164</span></span></a> As time
went on, and Monk's design to bring in Charles
became more apparent, the citizens grew yet bolder.
The Skinners' Company went so far as to set up again
the royal arms in their hall on the occasion of an
entertainment given to Monk himself.<a id="noteref_1165" name="noteref_1165" href="#note_1165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1165</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the close of April, when it was evident
that the king's restoration was a mere question of
time, the Common Council showed an anxiety to
place on record an account of the attitude taken
up by the City, and to vindicate its action throughout
the late troublous times. It appointed (26 April) a
committee "to peruse the records of this court and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
report what of them are fit to be considered of, and
their opinions thereupon; and also to prepare a
narrative for the vindication of this court and city
touching the same." The committee at once set to
work, and in four days were ready with a draft of
"a declaration and vindication of the lord mayor,
aldermen and commons of the city of London in
Common Council assembled," which received the
approval of the court (30 April), and a printed copy
of which was ordered to be sent to every member of
parliament and Council of State.<a id="noteref_1166" name="noteref_1166" href="#note_1166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1166</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After expressions of satisfaction at the thought of
an end having been put to the distractions of the kingdom
by General Monk, and at the hopeful prospect
of a return to the old form of government by king,
lords and commons, under which the country had so
long prospered at home and been respected abroad,
this declaration proceeded to disavow the various
Acts of the Common Council as established in 1648,
when, "in the general deluge of disorder introduced
upon these kingdoms" in that year, the government
of the city passed into the hands of "men of loose and
dangerous principles," who proceeded to pass Acts
"tending to the murder of the late king and total
extinguishment of kingly government," and who by
no means were a fair representation of the city. It
set forth various proceedings of the Common Council
in connection with parliament and the city's Engagement
to guarantee the personal safety of the late king<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the 22nd June, 1648, down to the 13th January,
1649, when the lord mayor Reynardson was constrained
to leave the council. The terms of this
Engagement the City was prepared to carry out,
"but it pleased Almighty God to permit their good
intentions and endeavours to be frustrated by the
destructive counsels and actings of those who had
designed to build upp their dominion and fortunes
on the ruin of the king and kingdom." The House
of Lords was dissolved, and all the best members
excluded from the House of Commons. By "pretended
ordinances" of parliament, all those worthy
citizens who, according to their allegiance and covenant,
had engaged to procure and secure a personal
treaty with the king, were rendered incapable to be
elected into the Common Council or any other office
of trust in the city.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What could be expected of a body thus emasculated?
They declare themselves unable to find words
to express their abhorrence of the proceedings that
had taken place in the Common Council of the 13th
January, 1649, and "profess their thankful memory
of the noble gallant resolutions of the then lord
mayor, Alderman Reynardson, and his brethren the
aldermen, who so valiantly resisted the turbulent
disorders of that <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanicke juncto</span></span> during many
hours' assault and at last prudently retreated and
washed their hands from the guilt of those bloody
resolves." In conclusion they express a hope and
trust that since the recovery of the right of free
election the Common Council had manifested an eagerness
to act cordially and strenuously with parliament
in everything tending towards good government, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that soon, by the aid of the parliament recently convened,
they would be put under the protection of
the first and fundamental government of hereditary
monarchy according to the ancient laws of the nation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City's declaration and vindication was scarcely

himself<a id="noteref_1167" name="noteref_1167" href="#note_1167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1167</span></span></a> was brought to the Common Council by Lord
Mordaunt and Sir John Grenville (1 May), in which
the prince expressed a wish that the City should know
how little he desired revenge and how convinced he
was that the peace, happiness and security of the kingdom
were only to be secured by gaining the hearts
and affections of his subjects. He felt that he could
count upon the City to assist him in re-establishing
those fundamental laws upon which the happiness of
the country so much depended, and he avowed a
"particular affection" for his native city, the charters
of which he was not only ready to renew and confirm,
but to grant such new favours as might advance
its trade, wealth and honour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Enclosed in this letter was a declaration known
as the Declaration of Breda, from the place where
Charles had signed it on the 4th April (o.s.)<a id="noteref_1168" name="noteref_1168" href="#note_1168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1168</span></span></a> It
offered a general pardon to all except those specially
exempted by parliament and promised liberty of
conscience in matters of religion. Charles further
expressed his willingness to leave questions of title to
estates acquired during the late troublous times to be
decided by parliament. He assured the soldiers of
arrears of pay and promised to continue them in his
service on the same terms as they then enjoyed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The letter and declaration having been read
(1 May), the Common Council returned thanks to
Charles for his condescension towards the City, and
expressed their willingness to submit to his majesty's
government, in token of which the arms of the
Commonwealth (he was informed) had already been
taken down and orders given for those of his majesty
to be set up. A committee was appointed to draw up
a formal answer in writing for conveyance to Charles
by the same hands that had brought his letter, provided
parliament would allow the City to return an
answer. The late king's statue, which had been
removed from the Guildhall chapel, was to be forthwith
set up again.<a id="noteref_1169" name="noteref_1169" href="#note_1169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1169</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles having shrewdly thrown upon parliament
the burden of naming the terms on which his restoration
was to take place, it became necessary that a
parliament should meet forthwith. Another Convention
Parliament had accordingly met on the 25th
April. The declaration of Breda reached it on the
1st May, and on the following day it sent to borrow
£100,000 from the City. The Common Council at
once took steps for raising the money.<a id="noteref_1170" name="noteref_1170" href="#note_1170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1170</span></span></a> One half of
this sum was destined for the king's own use, and
sorely he stood in need of it. Pepys, who had it from
an eye-witness, records "how overjoyed the king was
when Sir J. Grenville brought him some money; so
joyful that he called the Princess Royal and Duke
of York to look upon it as it lay in the portmanteau
before it was taken out."<a id="noteref_1171" name="noteref_1171" href="#note_1171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1171</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same day (2 May) that the Common Council
undertook to raise the loan for parliament it voted
on its own account a gift of £10,000 to Charles. It
also voted a sum of £2,000 for expenses in sending a
deputation to the Hague; but it was subsequently
resolved to divide the sum between the Dukes of
York and Gloucester, and that the members of the
deputation should discharge their own expenses. A
further sum of £300 was voted for Lord Mordaunt
and Sir John Grenville, the bearers of the king's
letters, for the purchase of a ring apiece. The sum
of £12,000 was raised among the livery companies
on the understanding that this was an exceptional
occasion and was not to be drawn into precedent.<a id="noteref_1172" name="noteref_1172" href="#note_1172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1172</span></span></a></p>

upon Thomas Aleyne, the lord mayor, and partook
of refreshment in the lord mayor's tent, set up for the

one long triumphal procession through streets strewn

Speaking on behalf of the City, the Recorder expressly
declared that it was done by way of restitution and
not as a gift. He assured the king that it was well
that the park had been in the City's hands, for they
had preserved the wood, vert and game. Not to be
outdone in courtesy the king replied that "the city
of London were still loading him with their kindness,

should be filled by restoring those aldermen who had
in times past been removed for their allegiance to him.
As many of the latter had submitted to pay fines
rather than continue in office against their conscience,
he further recommended that these fines should be
returned to them.<a id="noteref_1187" name="noteref_1187" href="#note_1187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1187</span></span></a> Pursuant to the king's wishes,

Alderman Adams and "brother" Bunce by resolution

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime (5 July) the king and parliament
had been entertained at dinner by the City with great
magnificence. The day was unfortunately rainy, and
Pepys, who seems never to have quite forgotten that
he was the son of a tailor, and never put on a new
suit of clothes without recording the fact in his diary,
remarks that the rain that day "spoiled many a fine
suit of clothes." The entertainment on this occasion
took place at the Guildhall instead of at the hall of
one of the great city companies. The mayor took
the opportunity in the course of the dinner to present<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the king with a "welcome cupp according to the
usuall custome," as a token of loyalty and duty.
On the following day the members of the Common
Council and the masters and wardens of those
companies which had advanced money to defray
the cost of the entertainment dined together in
the hall, when there was "the same musicke as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By October matters were so pressing that Charles
himself wrote to the City, insisting upon the money
being advanced within ten days upon the security of
the Act for two months' assessment about to be levied
on the whole kingdom, and out of which he solemnly
promised, "on the word of a king," that the loan, both
principal and interest, should be repaid before any other

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far all had gone well with Charles. Within
a month of his first letters from Breda he had
recovered his father's throne without shedding one
drop of blood. Of his enemies the more powerful
were either in prison or had fled the country, whilst
others had paid the penalty for their implication in
the death of the late king with their own heads.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Danger, however, lurked where least expected. A
small band of fanatics known by the name of Fifth
Monarchy men, who believed in the immediate
coming of Christ upon earth to rule the world, were
in the habit of holding meetings in Coleman Street.
On Sunday, the 6th January, 1661, excited by a
harangue uttered by their leader, a wine-cooper named
Venner, they broke out, and with arms in their hands
hurried to St. Paul's. There they posted sentries, and
demanded of passers-by whom were they for? Upon
one of them replying that he was for King Charles,
he was at once shot by the fanatics, who cried out
that they were for King Jesus. Luckily the city was
at the time in the hands of that staunch soldier Sir
Richard Browne. Upon his appearance on the scene
with an armed force the rioters retreated to Highgate,
but not before they had killed at least half-a-dozen
men. During the next two days the streets were
strongly patrolled; travellers abroad were strictly
examined as to the nature of their business before
being allowed to pass on their way, and suspected
persons were disarmed and compelled to take the
oaths of allegiance and supremacy.<a id="noteref_1199" name="noteref_1199" href="#note_1199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1199</span></span></a> Every moment
the return of the rioters was expected, but Monday
and Tuesday passed and none appeared. One of
their meeting houses (probably that in Coleman
Street) was ordered to be pulled down. At six
o'clock on Wednesday morning the inhabitants were
aroused by hearing again the cry of the fanatics, "The
King Jesus and their heads upon the gates," as they
madly attacked the king's life guards. Their whole<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
number, it is said, did not amount to much more than
thirty, of whom twenty were killed, whilst Venner
and nearly all the rest were made prisoners. When
questioned the prisoners one and all refused to make
any confession, saying that they would not betray
the servants of the Lord Jesus.<a id="noteref_1200" name="noteref_1200" href="#note_1200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1200</span></span></a> Ten days later they
expiated their crime on the scaffold, and the lord
mayor, having received orders to seize all suspected
persons in the city, proceeded to imprison a number
of Quakers. These he kept in confinement until the
following March, when all fear of further disturbance
having passed away, they were discharged.<a id="noteref_1201" name="noteref_1201" href="#note_1201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1201</span></span></a></p>

asking for another loan of £60,000. As the City was
anxious to have its rights and liberties ratified and

the loan was to be made upon parliamentary security.<a id="noteref_1206" name="noteref_1206" href="#note_1206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1206</span></span></a></p>

being taken to follow the old patterns as far as possible.
The new regalia comprised two crowns, three sceptres,
an orb, a mace and a quantity of collars, Georges and

of "Mr. Young's, the flagmaker," in Cornhill, and
declared it to be "impossible to relate the glory of

also a considerable amount of tippling. Even Pepys
himself was obliged to confess that he got to his bed
only "pretty well." There was but one accident
worth mentioning during the entire day. Sergeant
Glyn, who had formerly been the City's Recorder,
and had afterwards been raised to the Bench, was
nearly killed by his horse falling on him whilst riding

Presbyterian turn of mind freely expressed their
hopes that the keynote of the election struck by the
City would be taken up by the country at large.
"God has overruled the hearts of men and heard the
prayers of his people in the city election, though
the Episcopals were high and thought to have the

writes a contemporary to a friend.<a id="noteref_1221" name="noteref_1221" href="#note_1221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1221</span></span></a> "The city of

Another expresses a hope that "other places will
be encouraged by the example of this to choose
sober and moderate men for parliament men";
whilst another declares "the city was very unanimous
and courageous in its choice," and that "if the
country do the same, profaneness and superstition
will no longer prevail, but Godly magistrates
and ministers be settled in every place."<a id="noteref_1223" name="noteref_1223" href="#note_1223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1223</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the court party were afraid of the effect

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The new parliament agreed that neither House
could claim the command of the militia nor lawfully

against those who refused to conform to the Established

Thenceforth no one was to be allowed to hold any

took the oath of non-resistance, and received the
Sacrament according to the rites of the Church of
England. By thus excluding Nonconformists (or
"Dissenters," as they began now to be called) from

them from seats in the House of Commons.</p>

reminded of his own country by seeing the roofs of
the houses covered with snow.<a id="noteref_1260" name="noteref_1260" href="#note_1260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1260</span></span></a> At eight o'clock in
the morning 500 men "apparelled in velvet coats with
chains of gold, well mounted on horseback," from the
several livery companies made their way to Tower
Hill to escort the ambassador.<a id="noteref_1261" name="noteref_1261" href="#note_1261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1261</span></span></a> The streets were
lined with the city trained bands and the king's Lifeguards.
Pepys was there of course; he rarely missed
any sight. He had been disappointed at not getting
a better view of Sir Harry Vane's execution, which
had taken place in June.<a id="noteref_1262" name="noteref_1262" href="#note_1262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1262</span></span></a> This time he was more
fortunate. The ambassador to be sure was late, but
Pepys beguiled the time with dinner. "And after I
had dined"—he records in his diary<a id="noteref_1263" name="noteref_1263" href="#note_1263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1263</span></span></a>—"I walked to
the conduit in the quarrefowr, at the end of Gracious
Street and Cornhill and there (the spouts thereof
running very near me, upon all the people that were
under it) I saw them pretty well, go by." He
failed to catch sight of the ambassador himself, but
was struck with the handsome appearance of the
ambassador's attendants, most of whom carried hawks
on their "fists" as a present to Charles. The
strangeness of this sight caused the mob to jeer, upon
which the diarist characteristically remarks, "but
lord! to see the absurd nature of Englishmen that<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cannot forbear laughing and jeering at every thing
that looks strange." Later on he makes a note of
having seen the ambassador's retinue at York House
engaged in a manner that does not speak well for
their habits of cleanliness.<a id="noteref_1264" name="noteref_1264" href="#note_1264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1264</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding the supplies voted to him by
parliament, the advances made to him by the City,
and the handsome dowry he received with his wife,
Charles was continually in want of money. In
November, 1662, he had sold Dunkirk to the French
king for £200,000, much to the disgust of the English
nation. Nevertheless, his extravagance soon reduced
him to want, and by the following September (1663)
he was in such straits that he sent to the City to
borrow the comparatively small sum of £50,000.
Seeing that the City had so recently received a
confirmation of its charter, it could not refuse; and
the money was raised among the aldermen as being<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 29th October the new lord mayor, Sir
Anthony Bateman, entered upon his mayoralty,<a id="noteref_1269" name="noteref_1269" href="#note_1269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1269</span></span></a> with
the customary procession and pageant, followed by a
banquet at the Guildhall. The banquet was made
the occasion of what appears on the face of it to have
been a studied insult offered—not by the municipal
authorities, but by the lord chancellor, the bishops and
lords of the council—to the French ambassador.
Whether the lord chancellor and other high officers of
state arrived at the Guildhall before their time, or the
French ambassador came late, one cannot say. But,
however that may have been, it appears that on the
latter's arrival the others had already commenced
dinner, with the exception of the mayor himself and
the municipal authorities, who had not yet taken their
places. On the ambassador approaching the table
where the lords sat at dinner, intending, as he informed
the French king by letter,<a id="noteref_1270" name="noteref_1270" href="#note_1270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1270</span></span></a> to rally them on their<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
good appetite, he met with such a cold reception that
he left the hall to go home and dine by himself, in
spite of every endeavour on the part of the civic
officials to smooth matters over. Two hours later the
sheriffs presented themselves at the ambassador's
house, accompanied by a deputation from the Common
Council, for the purpose of offering excuses for the
recent <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">contretemps</span></span>. The excuses they had to offer
were, however, of the lamest character, as the
ambassador took care to show. Firstly, they said
they had been taken by surprise. This was
manifestly false, as the ambassador attended at
the Guildhall upon invitation. They next pleaded
ignorance and incapacity in receiving one of so
high degree, when the ambassador reminded them
that they had recently done honour to the Spanish
ambassador; and lastly they endeavoured to throw
the whole of the blame upon the master of the
ceremonies. This excuse, however, like the others,
was easily shown to be false, inasmuch as that official
was personally engaged in escorting the ambassador
to the Guildhall and had nothing to do with the
banquet. The deputation thereupon withdrew, being
all the more discomforted by the excess of courtesy
shown to them by the ambassador, who himself
insisted on escorting them to the door (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">je leur dis que

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 11th November the lord mayor went in
state to pay a visit to the ambassador and to beg his
forgiveness. Not being able to speak French himself,
he took with him an interpreter, who explained to
the ambassador on his behalf that unless he (the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

eternal shame would rest upon the citizens and
they would incur the displeasure of the king and

satisfied and attended the lord mayor to his carriage

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of a war with the Dutch, which seemed
inevitable, owing to their interference with English
trade, Charles began taking steps to replenish his
exhausted exchequer. In June and again in October
(1664) he borrowed from the city sums of £100,000.<a id="noteref_1272" name="noteref_1272" href="#note_1272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1272</span></span></a>
In November the Commons voted him a sum of two
millions and a half, a larger supply than any that
had ever yet been granted to a king of England, and
the thanks of both Houses were tendered to the city
for its assistance.<a id="noteref_1273" name="noteref_1273" href="#note_1273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1273</span></span></a> On the 22nd February, 1665, war
was formally declared. Two heralds, in their coats
of arms, with four mace-bearers, nine trumpeters
and two troops of horse, assembled at Westminster,
where the trumpet sounded and the declaration
was read amid shouts of joy. "Thence they went
to Temple Bar, where the lord mayor and aldermen,
in scarlet gowns on horse-back, conducted
them to Temple Gate over against Chancery<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lane, where it was read with more acclamation
than before, the Horseguards drawing their swords
and clattering them; then again in Cheapside

which deprived the fleet of one of its most valuable

Sir John Lawson was about to put to sea—and caused
the death of nearly 300 seamen. "The London"
was being brought round from Chatham to the Hope,
where she was to take on board her commander,
when for some unaccountable reason she blew up and
became a total wreck, all her ordnance, numbering
80 brass pieces, going to the bottom. The news of
the disaster caused much excitement in the city.<a id="noteref_1276" name="noteref_1276" href="#note_1276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1276</span></span></a></p>

was a matter of public notoriety that the money voted
expressly by parliament for fitting out a navy had
been uselessly squandered. It was said at the time,
although not credited by all, that many showed a
willingness to advance a large sum of money if the
Duke of York would guarantee its being employed
on the navy by himself becoming treasurer of the

in an unfinished state, and when her guns came to be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the outset of the war the British fleet was not
unattended with success. On the 3rd June, 1665, the
Duke of York gained a signal victory over Opdam,
admiral of the Dutch fleet, in an action fought off the
coast of Suffolk. The report of the guns could be
frequently heard on the Thames and caused much
excitement in the city,<a id="noteref_1284" name="noteref_1284" href="#note_1284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1284</span></span></a> to allay which the king
caused a letter to be despatched to the lord mayor as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a victory at another time would have been
hailed with unbounded joy. As it was the enthusiasm
of the citizens was damped by the presence among
them of the most awful scourge that had ever yet
visited the city. Towards the close of 1663 there
had been rumours of an outbreak of plague on the
continent, and more especially at Amsterdam and
Hamburgh. The king communicated with the lord<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mayor to learn what measures had formerly been
taken in like case to prevent the spread of infection.
It was suggested by the Court of Aldermen that, after
the custom of other countries, vessels coming from
infected parts should perform quarantine at Gravesend
or the neighbourhood, where a lazaretto should be
established. The proposal was accepted,<a id="noteref_1287" name="noteref_1287" href="#note_1287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1287</span></span></a> and to these
precautions, taken on the instigation of the city
authorities, was largely due the immunity from
infection which the city enjoyed for the next fifteen
months. In June, 1664, the lords of the council
adopted similar precautions as their own and wrote to
the lord mayor, in view of the increase of the plague
in the Netherlands, desiring him "by all waies and
meanes possible to be careful that no person or
persons, goods or merchandises whatsoever be
permitted to be received or harboured within the
citty of London which come from Holland, Zealand
or any other places infected with the plague,
without certificates from the farmers of the customs
or their officers that they have performed their
quarantain."<a id="noteref_1288" name="noteref_1288" href="#note_1288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1288</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plague made its first appearance in the city
in June, 1665. The atmosphere had been very
sultry—the 7th June being recorded by Pepys as the
hottest day he had ever felt in his life—and the heat
caused the infection to spread among the crowded
population of the city with amazing rapidity. Many<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
followed the example set by the king and court and
fled to the country.<a id="noteref_1289" name="noteref_1289" href="#note_1289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1289</span></span></a> The lord mayor, however, stuck
to his post, and the aldermen were forbidden to leave
the city without giving notice of some reasonable
cause, those who had already absented themselves
being ordered to return.<a id="noteref_1290" name="noteref_1290" href="#note_1290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1290</span></span></a> The good example thus set
was unhappily not followed by the city rectors.
Many of them, to their shame, forsook their cures
in abject fear, leaving their parishioners to die
without the consolations of the Church, whilst
their pulpits were seized upon by Presbyterian
ministers, who embraced the opportunity of publicly
declaiming against the sins of the court and the
ill usage to which they had been compelled to
submit.<a id="noteref_1291" name="noteref_1291" href="#note_1291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1291</span></span></a> The first Wednesday of every month was

and taverns kept open only for citizens. The
streets were cleansed and kept free from vagrant
dogs—always suspected of spreading infection.
Nevertheless, the death rate rapidly increased.
Pest-houses or hospitals were opened and the
best medical aid supplied, whilst subscriptions
were set on foot for the benefit of the poor.<a id="noteref_1293" name="noteref_1293" href="#note_1293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1293</span></span></a> The
last week of August claimed 700 victims within
the city's walls, whilst in the week ending the 19th
September no less than 1,189—the highest number<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
recorded perished within the same limited area.<a id="noteref_1294" name="noteref_1294" href="#note_1294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1294</span></span></a>
The number of deaths that occurred outside the city,
but within its liberties, was often three or four times
larger than of those within the city's walls. Thus for
the week last mentioned the number of deaths from
the plague alone in parishes outside the city, but
within its liberties, is returned in the Bills of Mortality
as having exceeded 3,000.<a id="noteref_1295" name="noteref_1295" href="#note_1295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1295</span></span></a> The continued increase
in the number of deaths in the first half of September
was a matter of surprise, for cold weather had set in
and the lord mayor had caused fires to be lighted in
the open thoroughfares for the benefit of the poor
that lay starving in the streets, as well as (perhaps)

the plague was at its height deaths followed in such
rapid succession that the work of burying its victims
had to be carried on night and day. Even then there
was only time to huddle the corpses together in a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fosse commune</span></span>, and to cover them with a scanty
supply of earth. Small wonder if complaints were
made to the Court of Aldermen of noisome smells
arising from the churchyard of St. Mary's Bethlem.
The court immediately (5 Sept.) gave orders for
remedying the evil. No more pits were to be dug,
but each corpse was to occupy a separate grave, fresh
mould was to be laid over places complained of, and
bones and coffin-boards found above ground were to
be interred in the middle of the churchyard.<a id="noteref_1297" name="noteref_1297" href="#note_1297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1297</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The worst was now over. From the middle of
September the number of deaths in the city began to
decrease almost as rapidly as they had risen. In the
first week in November there was a sudden increase
on the return of the previous week, but in the
following week there was again a fall, and this
continued until in the first week of December the
deaths in the city numbered only twenty-four.
Nevertheless it was thought advisable to prohibit
the usual entertainments which took place after the
wardmote elections on St. Thomas's day, in order to
minimise the risk of infection.<a id="noteref_1298" name="noteref_1298" href="#note_1298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1298</span></span></a> The mayor was
justified in taking this precaution, for the very next
week the number of deaths more than doubled itself
(57). That the city of London was at this time one
of the healthiest places in the kingdom is shown by
the fact that just as it was one of the last places
attacked by the plague, so it was one of the first
to become free, in spite of its having been made
"the receptacle of all the people from all infected
places."<a id="noteref_1299" name="noteref_1299" href="#note_1299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1299</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The total number of victims in the city proper
during the twelve month ending the 19th December,
1665, is officially given as 9,887. When we consider
that the entire population within the city walls—comprising
an area of one square mile, more or
less—could scarcely have reached 100,000,<a id="noteref_1300" name="noteref_1300" href="#note_1300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1300</span></span></a> the extent<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the calamity becomes appalling; the city was
literally decimated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the plague was raging the English fleet
had remained in the Thames, leaving the Dutch
masters of the sea. The opening of the new year
(1666) found England engaged in a war with France,
as well as with the Dutch. Louis, however, was
content to leave the English and the Dutch to settle
matters between themselves at sea. On the 1st June
a desperate naval battle commenced off the North
Foreland and continued for four days, at the end of
which neither party could claim a victory. Both
fleets withdrew for repairs. It was at this crisis that
the "Loyal London" was hastily launched and application
made to the city for a loan of £100,000. The
money was readily voted, contrary to expectations.<a id="noteref_1301" name="noteref_1301" href="#note_1301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1301</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the last instalment (£1,500) of the loan
was paid into the exchequer, the Guildhall and its
surroundings were being threatened with destruction
by the Great Fire,<a id="noteref_1302" name="noteref_1302" href="#note_1302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1302</span></span></a> which, breaking out on the night
of Saturday, 1st September, 1666, or early on Sunday
morning, at a baker's shop in Pudding Lane, within
five days reduced the greater part of the city to ashes.
The king had long ago anticipated such a calamity,
arising from the narrowness of the streets and the
overhanging houses built for the most part of wood.
More than a year before (11 April, 1665) he had written
to the mayor, recorder and aldermen of the city<a id="noteref_1303" name="noteref_1303" href="#note_1303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1303</span></span></a>
warning them of the danger and recommending a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more diligent execution of the Act for the repair of
highways and sewers. He authorised them to imprison
such persons as, after due warning, continued
to erect buildings in contravention of the Act, and to
pull the buildings down. He further desired them to
open Temple Bar and the passage and gatehouse of
Cheapside in St. Paul's Churchyard, as mentioned in
the Act, and he would himself inspect what progress
was being made in carrying out these improvements.
He concluded by declaring that he had made the city
his royal residence,<a id="noteref_1304" name="noteref_1304" href="#note_1304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1304</span></span></a> and had received from it such
marks of loyalty and affection as would ever make
him concerned for its wealth, trade, reputation, beauty
and convenience.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The outbreak of the fire at first caused no uneasiness,
such sights being only too common. But
when no less than 300 houses had been destroyed
within a few hours, and the flames, carried by a
strong east wind that prevailed, threatened others,
the inhabitants began to take alarm. The mayor, Sir
Thomas Bludworth, was early on the scene, but he
lacked decision of character and failed to keep his
head. He endeavoured to carry out the king's orders
by pulling down houses to prevent the fire spreading,
but as often as not he was overtaken by the flames.
"Lord, what can I do?" he lack-a-daisically exclaimed
in answer to a message from the king; "I
am spent; people will not obey me. I have been
pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us
faster than we can do it."<a id="noteref_1305" name="noteref_1305" href="#note_1305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1305</span></span></a> The inhabitants were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
too busy removing their furniture and effects to a
place of safety to render much assistance to the
mayor, but he found willing hands in the soldiers
supplied by the king and the Duke of York, both
of whom displayed great personal energy. "The
Duke of York," wrote an eye-witness of the mournful
scene,<a id="noteref_1306" name="noteref_1306" href="#note_1306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1306</span></span></a> "hath wonn the hearts of the people w<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
his continuall and indefatigable paynes day and
night in helping to quench the fire, handing bucketts
of water with as much diligence as the poorest
man that did assist; if the lord maior had done
as much his example might have gone far towards
saveing the citty."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of every effort to stay its progress the
fire continued to rage throughout the whole of Monday
and Tuesday. By this time Lombard Street,
Cannon Street and Gracechurch Street had been
reduced to ashes. The houses on London Bridge
were attacked and Southwark threatened with destruction.
On Wednesday the flames devastated
Cornhill and the Exchange. The following day they
got hold of St. Paul's (at that time undergoing repairs
and surrounded with scaffolding), and were carried by
the east wind towards the Temple and Hatton Garden.
The brick buildings of the Temple offered a
more stubborn resistance than the wooden buildings
of the city, and prevented the fire spreading further
westward.<a id="noteref_1307" name="noteref_1307" href="#note_1307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1307</span></span></a> In the meantime resort was had to gunpowder
for the quicker destruction of houses in the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
city, and by this means much was eventually saved
which otherwise would inevitably have been lost. But
this was not done without considerable opposition from
the owners of houses who objected to their property
being blown up if there was a chance of it being saved.<a id="noteref_1308" name="noteref_1308" href="#note_1308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1308</span></span></a>
At last the "horrid, malicious, bloody flame," described
by Pepys as so unlike the flame of an ordinary
fire, burnt itself out, and at the close of Thursday,
the 6th September, the inhabitants of the city were
able for the first time since the outbreak to seek a
night's rest without fear of further danger. When
they rose the next morning and contemplated the
extent of the havoc wrought on their city by the
fire, the hearts of many must have fairly sunk
within them. At least four-fifths of the whole of the
buildings situate within the walls had been reduced to
ashes. The official report was that no less than
13,200 houses and eighty-nine parish churches, besides
St. Paul's and divers chapels, were destroyed, and
that only seventy-five acres out of a total of 373 acres
of ground within the walls escaped the conflagration.<a id="noteref_1309" name="noteref_1309" href="#note_1309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1309</span></span></a>
These seventy-five acres chiefly lay in the vicinity of
Aldgate and Tower Hill, and probably owed their
immunity from the fire to the free use of gunpowder,
for it was in Tower Street, Pepys tells us, that the
practice of blowing up houses began. Most of the
livery companies lost their halls. Clothworkers' Hall
burned for three days and three nights, the flames
being fed with the oil that was stored in its cellars.
The Leaden Hall was partly saved. Gresham House<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also escaped; but the Guildhall suffered severely,
its outer walls only being left standing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much dissatisfaction was displayed against Bludworth
for his want of resolution during the crisis,<a id="noteref_1310" name="noteref_1310" href="#note_1310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1310</span></span></a>
and when Michaelmas-day arrived, and he was about
to go out of office, he was called to account for his
conduct. In anticipation of lord mayor's day he wrote
to Joseph Williamson, afterwards Secretary of State,
bespeaking his favour and support. He professed not
to live by popular applause (he said), but he needed
and desired the support and esteem of government,
"having had the misfortune to serve in the severest
year that ever man did."<a id="noteref_1311" name="noteref_1311" href="#note_1311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1311</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the origin of the fire the wildest rumours
at the time prevailed, and for years afterwards it was
commonly attributed to Papists wishing to destroy
the stronghold of the reformed religion, notwithstanding
the fact that not a scintilla of evidence was
forthcoming in support of such a charge, after a most
careful investigation.<a id="noteref_1312" name="noteref_1312" href="#note_1312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1312</span></span></a> The citizens were not satisfied
with the first inquiry, and in March, 1668, a

re-open the question and to receive fresh evidence.<a id="noteref_1313" name="noteref_1313" href="#note_1313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1313</span></span></a>
Thirteen years later the belief that the Papists had
a hand in causing the wholesale destruction of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

perpetuated by an inscription on the Monument
commemorating the fire, an inscription which met
with the approval of the municipal authorities of
the day.<a id="noteref_1315" name="noteref_1315" href="#note_1315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1315</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day (8 Sept.) the court gave permission
for any freeman of the city to erect a tent or shed
wherein to carry on his trade or craft on any part of
the artillery ground, or if he so wished, either outside
London wall between the postern near Broad
Street and Moorgate, or within the wall between the
said postern and Coleman Street. He might also
erect his tent or shed in the "Round" at Smithfield.
But in every case the ground was to be set out as
apportioned by the mayor and sheriffs with the
assistance of "Mr." [Peter] Mills. Those who had
formerly kept shop in the upper "pawne" of the
Royal Exchange were at the same time permitted
to erect sheds under certain conditions.<a id="noteref_1325" name="noteref_1325" href="#note_1325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1325</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Monday, the 10th September, the Common
Council met. It is the first court since the fire of
which any record has come down to us. Its first care
was to order every street and lane in each ward to be
cleared of all rubbish by the late inhabitants, "every
one before his grounds," and by no one else. It next
proceeded to nominate a committee of aldermen and
commoners to consider the best means of raising the
city out of its ruins, and it was agreed that the Common
Council should sit every Wednesday at Gresham
House.<a id="noteref_1326" name="noteref_1326" href="#note_1326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1326</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the fire was at its height the king had
been anxious to send for the Duke of Albemarle, but
hesitated to do so fearing lest he would be unwilling
to be ordered home whilst engaged in the Dutch war.<a id="noteref_1327" name="noteref_1327" href="#note_1327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1327</span></span></a>
Representations of the king's wishes, however, having<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been made to the duke, he hurried home. On the
12th September a committee was appointed by the
Court of Aldermen to wait upon him with a draft
proclamation for the discovery and restoration of
goods taken either wilfully, ignorantly, or of purpose
during the confusion consequent on the late fire.<a id="noteref_1328" name="noteref_1328" href="#note_1328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1328</span></span></a>
The quantity of plate, money, jewels, household
stuff, goods and merchandise discovered among the
ruins was very great, and much of it had quickly
been misappropriated. The proclamation ordered all
persons who had so misappropriated property to bring
the same within eight days into the armoury in Finsbury
Fields; and by order of the Common Council
no such property was to be given up to any claimant
without permission of the Court of Aldermen or the
lord mayor and sheriffs for the time being.<a id="noteref_1329" name="noteref_1329" href="#note_1329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1329</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A month later (19 Oct.) a letter was addressed
to the mayor signed by the archbishop of Canterbury,
the lords Clarendon, Albemarle, Manchester, Arlington
and others, complaining that sundry materials of
city churches destroyed by the fire had been embezzled
and stolen, and also that smiths' forges and
other artificers' shops and even alehouses were kept
within the sacred ruins. The mayor was directed,
with the assistance of the Court of Aldermen, to obtain
inventories of all communion plate, vestments, records,
books and other goods belonging to each church that
the fire had destroyed, and of all that remained to
each church after the fire, and he was to cause the
plate and goods that survived the fire to be preserved<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for future use in their respective churches. He was
further directed to collect and preserve the lead,
bells and other appurtenances and materials of the
various churches in order to assist in repairing and
re-building them, and to prohibit any trade or selling
of ale, beer, tobacco or victuals within their precincts.<a id="noteref_1330" name="noteref_1330" href="#note_1330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1330</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One effect of the fire, which was estimated at

which usually marked the day when the newly elected
mayor proceeded to the Exchequer to be sworn.
When Bludworth's successor—Sir William Bolton—went
to take the oath on the 29th October, the
meanness of the appearance of the civic fathers was
remarked by the on-lookers, who reflected "with

the Court of Aldermen, considering how difficult it

for insurance against fire, and in 1681 a deed of conveyance

as security to persons effecting insurances against fire.<a id="noteref_1334" name="noteref_1334" href="#note_1334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1334</span></span></a>
That the municipal body of the city should undertake

<a name="toc254" id="toc254"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Great Fire had scarcely ceased smouldering
before the inhabitants of the city set to work re-building
their devastated houses. Information having
reached the ear of the king that building operations
were about to be carried out on the old foundations,
he instructed Sir William Morice, secretary of state,
to write to the lord mayor to put a stop to them until
further orders, as his majesty had under consideration
certain models and plans for re-building the city
"with more decency and conveniency than formerly."<a id="noteref_1336" name="noteref_1336" href="#note_1336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1336</span></span></a>
Charles himself also wrote at the same time to the
mayor and aldermen desiring them to afford every
assistance to Wenceslas Hollar and Francis Sandford,
whom he had appointed to make an exact survey of
the city as it stood after the fire.<a id="noteref_1337" name="noteref_1337" href="#note_1337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1337</span></span></a> The civic authorities
on their part instructed Robert Hooke to devise
a scheme for re-building the city, and on the 21st
September he presented to the Common Council
"an exquisite modell or draught" which found much
favour with the court.<a id="noteref_1338" name="noteref_1338" href="#note_1338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1338</span></span></a> Early in the following

that for the greater expedition in carrying out the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
work of re-building the city, the king had appointed
Wren and two others to make a survey, with the
assistance of such surveyors and workmen as the civic
authorities should nominate. The city's choice fell
upon Robert Hooke, described as "Reader of the
Mathematicks in Gresham Colledge," Peter Mills and
Edward Jermyn or Jarman. By way of preparation
for the survey, the owners of houses that had been
destroyed were again ordered (9 Oct.) to clear their
foundations of rubbish, and to pile up the bricks
and stones within fourteen days, so that every man's
property might be "more exactly measured and
asserted."<a id="noteref_1339" name="noteref_1339" href="#note_1339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1339</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impracticability of re-building the city except
on old foundations soon become manifest, and the
handsome design which Wren prepared had to be
dismissed. There was difficulty enough as it was,
and the four sworn viewers of the city whose duty at
ordinary times was to guard against encroachments
and other nuisances were unusually busy. Sometimes
the old foundations proved too weak to support a new
building, sometimes the new building threatened to
encroach on the public thoroughfare. Such matters
required the constant attention of the viewers. Disputes
would also arise between the landlords and
tenants of houses destroyed by the fire. In order to
settle all differences that arose, a special Court of
Judicature was established by Act of Parliament
(31 Jan., 1667).<a id="noteref_1340" name="noteref_1340" href="#note_1340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1340</span></span></a> The court sat at Clifford's Inn, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst a Bill for re-building the city was being
prepared for parliament the civic authorities were
busy considering how to find the money necessary
for re-building the Guildhall, the city's gates, the
prisons and other public buildings. On the 6th
November (1666) the Court of Aldermen resolved
to sit every Wednesday afternoon at the house of
the new lord mayor (Sir William Bolton) to consider
this important question, and to continue such weekly
sittings until the matter was settled.<a id="noteref_1344" name="noteref_1344" href="#note_1344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1344</span></span></a>  It was not<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
long before the court determined to apply to parliament
for an imposition of twelve pence a chaldron
on coals brought into the Port of London, wherewith
to meet the expense. The advice and assistance
of the solicitor-general and of Sir Job Charlton
were to be solicited, and £10 in "old gold" given
to each of them, in addition to "such other charges
and rewards" as might be necessary for the furtherance
of the business.<a id="noteref_1345" name="noteref_1345" href="#note_1345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1345</span></span></a> Later on the court resolved

Bill was brought in and read the first time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For fear lest some of the clauses might offend
the king a petition was drawn up for presentation to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the Court of Aldermen had drafted
(22 Jan.) a petition to the king for permission to
introduce a Bill for an impost on coals, to assist
the City in re-building the conduits, aqueducts and

In September the Common Council resolved that the
new street which it was proposed to make from the
Guildhall to Cheapside should be called King Street,
whilst its continuation from Cheapside to the river
should be known as Queen Street.<a id="noteref_1360" name="noteref_1360" href="#note_1360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1360</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A fresh distribution of markets and market places
was proposed (21 Oct.).<a id="noteref_1361" name="noteref_1361" href="#note_1361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a> Three markets and no
more were to be allotted for the sale of flesh and
other victuals brought into the city by country
butchers and farmers, viz., Leadenhall and the Greenyard
for the east end of the city, Honey Lane for the
centre, and a market near Warwick Lane, which was
to take the place of Newgate Market, for the west
end. Two places were to be assigned for herb and
fruit markets, viz., the site of the king's wardrobe (if
the king would give his consent) and the ground
whereon recently had stood the church of St. Laurence
Pulteney. The markets formerly held in Aldersgate
Street and Gracechurch Street were to be discontinued.
A place was to be found at or near Christ Church as
a site for the meat market, hitherto kept in Newgate
market. These suggestions were with slight alteration
accepted in the following February (1668), when
provision was also made for a fish market on the
site of the ancient stocks and the Woolchurch and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

in state into the city to lay "the first stone of the
first pillar of the new building of the Exchange."<a id="noteref_1363" name="noteref_1363" href="#note_1363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1363</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impost of twelve pence a chaldron on coals
brought into the port of London was soon found
inadequate to meet the expense of re-building the
Guildhall, the prisons and other public edifices of the
city, and in 1670 it was raised by statute (22 Car. II,
c. 11) to two shillings a chaldron. Great irregularities,
however, were allowed to take place in collecting
and accounting for the duty thus imposed, and
between 1667 and 1673 the City was obliged to borrow
no less than £83,000.<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364" href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a> In March, 1667, the Court of
Aldermen resolved that all fines paid by persons to be
discharged from the office of alderman between that
day and Midsummer next should be devoted to the
restoration of the Guildhall and the Justice Hall, Old
Bailey.<a id="noteref_1365" name="noteref_1365" href="#note_1365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1365</span></span></a> Not only money but material also was required
to enable the City to carry out its building
operations. To this end a Bill was introduced into
parliament to facilitate the City's manufacture of lime,
brick and tile.<a id="noteref_1366" name="noteref_1366" href="#note_1366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1366</span></span></a> A sub-tenant of the City holding five

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile negotiations for a peace had
been opened at Breda. The Londoners more especially
desired peace<a id="noteref_1369" name="noteref_1369" href="#note_1369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1369</span></span></a> in order to devote their energies
to re-building their city. In anticipation of a cessation
of hostilities Charles set about discharging his navy,
leaving the Thames and Medway open to attack. The
Dutch took advantage of his precipitancy and at once
sailed up the Medway, burnt three men-of-war, among
them being the "Loyal London," and carried off a
fourth.<a id="noteref_1370" name="noteref_1370" href="#note_1370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1370</span></span></a> This took place in June (1667). The city never
presented so dejected an appearance as on the arrival
of the news of this disgrace. The cry of treason was
raised and endeavours made to fasten the blame upon
any one and every one. The Dutch fleet was every
hour expected up the Thames,<a id="noteref_1371" name="noteref_1371" href="#note_1371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1371</span></span></a> and vessels were sunk
in the bed of the channel at Barking, Woolwich and
Blackwall to stop its progress. But so great was
the confusion that one of the king's store ships for
victualling the navy is said to have been sunk
among the rest, as well as vessels that had been
fitted out as fire-ships at great expense. The Common
Council interposed on behalf of interested owners of
merchandise on board the ship "Diana," lying in the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Thames, to prevent if possible the sinking of that
vessel.<a id="noteref_1372" name="noteref_1372" href="#note_1372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1372</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Common Council ordered (13 June) every
able-bodied man in the city forthwith to enlist, and
resolved to petition the king that the auxiliaries then

The same day the city's militia was reviewed by
Charles himself on Tower Hill. He addressed them
in a speech assuring them that he would personally
share their danger. But here, too, was confusion and
lack of organization. "The city is troubled at their
being put upon duty," wrote Pepys (14 June),
"summoned one hour and discharged two hours after:
and then again summoned two hours after that; to
their great charge as well as trouble."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Above all there was a lack of money to pay the
seamen. Had the Dutch fleet sailed up the Thames
immediately after its success at Chatham, instead of
wasting its time at Portsmouth and Plymouth and
other places on the south coast, matters would have
gone hard with the capital. As it was the delay
gave time for recovery from the recent scare and for
measures to be taken against its approach, with the
result that after getting up the river as far as Tilbury
it was compelled to retire.<a id="noteref_1374" name="noteref_1374" href="#note_1374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1374</span></span></a></p>

day (21 June) the mayor and aldermen obeyed a
summons to attend upon the king in council, when,
a proposal having been made to fortify Sheerness and
other places on the river, they agreed to raise the
sum of £10,000 for the purpose.<a id="noteref_1376" name="noteref_1376" href="#note_1376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1376</span></span></a> That the government
should be driven to borrow so small a sum
excited the contempt of Pepys, who thought it "a
very poor thing that we should be induced to borrow
by such mean sums." That the City could afford no
more is not surprising when we consider what had
been the state of trade during the last three years.
As it was the money was paid by small instalments.
The coffers of the city merchant or goldsmith keeping
"running cashes" were well nigh empty, and the
credit of some of the best men was shaken.<a id="noteref_1377" name="noteref_1377" href="#note_1377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1377</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was another difficulty besides the want of
money. There was a deficiency of workmen to carry
out the works at Sheerness. Application was accordingly
made to the wardens of the several companies

the fortifications might be completed before the cold

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bells were set ringing in honour of the event, but
there were no bonfires at night "partly"—writes
Pepys—"from the dearness of firing, but principally
from the little content most people have in the
peace." Yet the terms of the treaty were not
wholly ruinous to the country. England, at least,
gained New York, hitherto known as New Amsterdam.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lull in the storm afforded the municipal
authorities an opportunity of taking stock of their own
Chamber. To this end a committee was appointed
on the 12th February, 1668. For nine months that
committee was employed examining the state of
the City's finances, and then had not finished their
task. Nevertheless, on the 23rd November they
made a report to the Common Council of the result
of their labours so far as they had gone.<a id="noteref_1379" name="noteref_1379" href="#note_1379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1379</span></span></a> The state
of the Chamber, they said, was so low that it would
require the utmost care and industry to restore it and
save it from utter decay and ruin, "for what by misemployment
of the treasure in the late troubles
and other ill managements," as well as by extraordinary
expenses occasioned by the Plague and Fire,
the City's debt had still increased notwithstanding
its income having been largely augmented by fines of
aldermen and chamber and bridge-house leases, which
within the last fifteen years had exceeded £200,000.
It was clear that when these extraordinary accessories
to the City's income ceased—and they had already
begun to decline—the City's debt would increase and
would indeed become desperate unless some remedy
were found. The committee, therefore, made certain<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suggestions with the view of cutting down expenses.
The City Chronologer,<a id="noteref_1380" name="noteref_1380" href="#note_1380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1380</span></span></a> in the first place, could be
dispensed with altogether. The salary of the City
Waits, which had lately been increased, should be
reduced to its former amount. Some saving might
be made in allowance of stationery in the various
offices, in expenses attending Courts of Conservancy,
in allowance of boots to City labourers and artificers.
The personal expenses of the City's Remembrancer for
diet, coach hire, boat hire, etc., should be no longer
allowed; and the Chamber should not be called upon
to make any disbursement for military purposes
beyond the sum of £4,666 13<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 4<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>, for which the
City was yearly liable by Act of Parliament. Lastly,
neither the court of Aldermen nor the court of
Common Council ought to have power to draw upon
the Chamber for a sum exceeding £500, except it
were in connection with the re-building of the Guildhall
and other specified objects. These and other
recommendations of the committee, being carefully
considered by the court, were for the most part
accepted with certain amendments.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand there was due to the city's

This sum Alderman Backwell undertook himself to

Ward, was one of those city princes whose wealth
brought them into close relation with the Crown.
A goldsmith by trade, he, like others of his class, took
to keeping "running cashes" and transacting generally
the business of a banker at his house known as the
"Unicorn" in Lombard Street. Pepys mentions him
frequently in his Diary. In the days of the Commonwealth
he was paymaster of the garrison at Dunkirk,
and continued to act as financial agent in all matters
connected with that town until it was sold to the
French king. His house in Lombard Street having
perished in the Great Fire, he was, by the king's
special command, accommodated with lodgings in
Gresham College, in order that his business relations
with the king might not be interrupted pending the
re-building of his premises.<a id="noteref_1382" name="noteref_1382" href="#note_1382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1382</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March, 1669, a riot occurred in the Temple on
the occasion of the mayor and aldermen going to dine
with the reader of the Inner Temple. The question
whether the Temple is situate within the city and
liberties or not was then a debateable one, whatever it
may be at the present day. The lord mayor of that time
(William Turner) evidently thought that it lay within
his jurisdiction, and insisted upon being preceded by
the city's sword-bearer carrying the sword up. To this
the students strongly objected. The story, as told by
Pepys, is to the effect that on Wednesday, 3rd March,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
"my lord mayor being invited this day to dinner at
the readers at the Temple, and endeavouring to
carry his sword up, the students did pull it down,
and forced him to go and stay all the day in a private
counsellor's chamber until the reader himself could
get the young gentlemen to dinner; and then my
lord mayor did retreat out of the Temple by stealth
with his sword up. This do make great heat among
the students, and my lord mayor did send to the
king, and also I hear that Sir Richard Browne did
cause the drums to beat for the trained bands;
but all is over, only I hear that the students do
resolve to try the charter of the city." From a
draft report<a id="noteref_1383" name="noteref_1383" href="#note_1383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1383</span></span></a> of the incident which was probably made
for the purpose of being laid before the Council
Board,<a id="noteref_1384" name="noteref_1384" href="#note_1384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1384</span></span></a> we learn that as soon as the civic procession
entered the Temple cloisters it was met by a man
named Hodges and others coming down the back
stairs of the Inner Temple Hall; that Hodges
threatened the lord mayor if he would not take
down his sword, declaring that the Temple was excepted
out of the city's charter, that the sword was
not the king's sword, but the lord mayor's, and that
"they were as good men as he, and no respect was
to be given him there." A struggle then took place
for the possession of the sword, in which the sword-bearer
was slightly hurt and some of the pearls from
the scabbard were lost. The students made a snatch at
the "cap of maintenance" worn by the sword-bearer.
The marshal's men who were in attendance suffered
some rough treatment, and narrowly escaped being<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
put under the pump. The mayor and aldermen in
the meanwhile sought refuge in the chambers of Mr.
Auditor Phillips, and awaited the return of Sir John
Nicholas, who with the recorder and the sheriffs had
been despatched to Whitehall to report the matter to
the king. As soon as they returned the mayor and
aldermen essayed to make their way out of the
Temple, but were again opposed by the students, with
Hodges at their head. The scene was one of wild
excitement and confusion; blows were showered upon
the aldermen, and one of the sheriffs was seized by
the collar in the frantic attempts of the students to
pull down the sword. The mayor and aldermen were
called "cuckolds," and their officers "dogs, rogues,
rascals and other very bad names." Some of the
students are said to have had weapons concealed under
their gowns, and to have threatened to draw them.
The sheriffs, the recorder and Sir John Nicholas having
again been sent to the king, it was intimated to the
mayor by some of the benchers, and by Mr. Goodfellow,
the Reader, at whose invitation the civic fathers
were in the Temple, that he might now leave without
any interruption (the "young gentlemen," according
to Pepys, had been persuaded to go to dinner), which,
after some display of opposition, he was allowed to do.
Such is the City's own version of the affair, which
concludes with the remark "that the proceedings
aforesaid were greatly affrontive and dishonourable
to the government of the city," a remark with
which most people will be disposed to agree. Nor is
it surprising to find that two years later the mayor
and aldermen declined a similar invitation from
Sir Francis North to attend his "feast" at the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

threatened if the sword should be borne up before his
lordship.<a id="noteref_1385" name="noteref_1385" href="#note_1385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1385</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In July, 1670—at a time when the City could ill

treaty with France (1 June), whereby he had pledged
himself to assist the French king in subjugating Holland,
in return for pecuniary support. The City agreed
to advance the money, but in order to raise the sum
required it became necessary to draw upon the coal
dues.<a id="noteref_1387" name="noteref_1387" href="#note_1387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1387</span></span></a> Much opposition was raised to the loan by

In addition to the loan by the City Charles obtained
considerable supplies from parliament when
it met in the autumn. The House had been kept in
complete ignorance of the arrangement that had
been made with France, and voted the money on
the understanding that it would be used in assisting
the Dutch against Louis and not Louis against the
Dutch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to keep up the illusion Charles treated
the Prince of Orange (afterwards William III of England),
who was on a visit to this country at the time,
with the highest consideration and insisted on the lord

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as parliament had voted supplies it was
prorogued (11 Dec.), Charles and his "cabal" being
determined to have no restraint put upon them in
carrying out the terms of the shameful treaty with
France. No long time elapsed before they had to
face the difficulty of an empty exchequer. It was
useless to declare war without funds. Charles was at
his wits' end for money and promised high office to
any one who should point out a successful way of
raising it. Clifford and Ashley, two members of the
cabal, put their heads together and hit upon the bold
plan of declaring a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">moratorium</span></span>, or suspension of payments
out of the royal exchequer. For many years
past it had been the custom for the goldsmiths of
London and others who had been in the habit of
keeping the money of private individuals, either on
deposit or running account, to lend it to the king, who
could afford to pay them a higher rate of interest than
they paid to their private customers. The money was
paid into the exchequer, the bankers taking assignments
of the public revenue for payment of principal
and interest, as it came in. Most of this money had
already been spent by Charles in paying off the fleet
that brought him over, and in carrying on the late war
with the Dutch;<a id="noteref_1391" name="noteref_1391" href="#note_1391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1391</span></span></a> but the bankers and capitalists who
had provided the money were content to abide by the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
king's frequent assurance that he would continue to
make good all assignments until their whole debt
should be wiped out. We may judge therefore of
their surprise and disappointment when they learnt,
as they did on the 2nd January, 1672, that the king
proposed to suspend all payments out of the public
revenue for one whole year!</p>

interest on the whole as some compensation to his
creditors for the delay; but this, even if carried into
practice, proved unavailing to ward off disaster.
The inevitable crash came. Many of the London
bankers, and among them Alderman Backwell, who
held revenue assignments exceeding a quarter of a
million sterling, were made utterly bankrupt. A few
of them who had interest at court got wind of the
threatened danger and managed to withdraw their
money from the exchequer in time, whilst Shaftesbury,
one of the prime movers in closing the exchequer,
foreseeing the inevitable result, took all of his own
money out of his banker's hands and warned his friends
to do the same.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exchequer having been in this way made
richer by £1,300,000, Charles was prepared to declare
war. An attempt to intercept a fleet of Dutch merchantmen
before any declaration of war had been
made—a piratical act admitting of no possible justification—brought
matters to a climax and war was
declared (17 March, 1672) by England and France.
The 27th March was appointed by royal proclamation
to be kept as a solemn fast for the purpose of begging
the Almighty's blessing on his majesty's forces, the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The war, which was chiefly remarkable for the
noble stand made by the Dutch under the young
William, Prince of Orange, Charles's own nephew and
afterwards King of England, soon drained the king's
resources, and once more he had to face a parliament.
The parliament, which met on the 4th February, 1673,
showed itself willing to vote a subsidy of £70,000 a
month for a period of eighteen months, but only on its
own terms. These were (1) the repeal of the Declaration
of Indulgence which Charles, who was beginning to
show signs of favouring the Roman Church, had by a
stretch of prerogative recently caused to be issued, and
(2) the passing of a Test Act which should bind all public
officers to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance,
receive the sacrament, and abjure the doctrine of
transubstantiation. By this means parliament hoped
to maintain the supremacy of the Church.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The assessments which the City was now called
upon to pay were far beyond its powers, seeing that
many merchants and traders who had left the
city at the time of the Plague and Fire refused to
return, preferring to live in the suburbs, and thus a
large number of the houses that had recently been
re-built were left unoccupied. Every exertion was
made to get some remission of the burden, but
although the king signified his intention of making
some abatement, little appears to have been done.<a id="noteref_1393" name="noteref_1393" href="#note_1393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1393</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March of this year (1673) an individual

for raising money by way of annuities to be granted
by the city to every subscriber of £20 or more.<a id="noteref_1394" name="noteref_1394" href="#note_1394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1394</span></span></a>
The matter was in the first instance brought before
the Court of Aldermen, who, upon consideration,
declared that the proposal appeared to them "very
faire and reasonable, and in all likelihood of very
great advantage to the city," and forthwith resolved
themselves into a committee of the whole court to
treat with Cardonel and take such further proceedings
as might be thought requisite.<a id="noteref_1395" name="noteref_1395" href="#note_1395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1395</span></span></a> In the following
month (11 April) the same proposals were submitted
to the Common Council, where they met with similar
favour. The court also appointed a committee to
take them into further consideration, promising in
the meantime that no advantage should be taken or
benefit derived from the scheme without the special
leave and consent of the proposer.<a id="noteref_1396" name="noteref_1396" href="#note_1396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1396</span></span></a> Although the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By February of the next year (1674) trade had
become so bad that a number of the inhabitants of
the city petitioned the Common Council (13 Feb.)
to seek some relief from parliament. An address<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was accordingly drawn up, setting forth the miserable
state to which the city had been reduced by the
ravages of the plague and the fire, the increase of
new buildings in the suburbs, which not only injured
the trade of the city, but afforded a retreat for
disorderly persons, and excessive taxation (the city
being called upon to pay the same amount of taxes
as in its most prosperous days), and praying the
Commons to apply some timely remedy. The address
was to have been laid before the house on Monday,
the 23rd February,<a id="noteref_1398" name="noteref_1398" href="#note_1398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1398</span></span></a> but no mention of it appears in
the Commons Journal. On the 24th the House was
prorogued.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In September (1674) the old question again
cropt up as to the power of the Court of Aldermen
to veto matters ordained by the Common Council.
The question had arisen, it will be remembered, in
January, 1649,<a id="noteref_1399" name="noteref_1399" href="#note_1399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1399</span></span></a> when Reynardson, the mayor, got up
and left the Common Council, followed by the
aldermen, and the court, instead of breaking up
according to custom, proceeded to pass measures in
their absence. Its action on this occasion was
reported to parliament, and the house signified its
approval of the court's proceedings and passed an
ordinance which practically deprived the Court of
Aldermen of all control over the Common Council.
Since that time the matter had remained dormant, until
jealousy between the two bodies was again excited by
the Common Council passing an Act (17 Sept., 1674)
for compelling the aldermen to reside within the city<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under the penalty of a fine of £500.<a id="noteref_1400" name="noteref_1400" href="#note_1400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1400</span></span></a> Against the
passing of any such Act the Recorder, on behalf of
the Court of Aldermen, formally reported their protest
to the Common Council, and the Commons as
formerly protested against that protest (13 Nov.).<a id="noteref_1401" name="noteref_1401" href="#note_1401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1401</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not that the mayor and aldermen were
not fully conscious of the mischief arising from their
own non-residence in the city, for they themselves
passed an order for every alderman to return with
his family into the city before the following Easter on
pain of heavy penalty,<a id="noteref_1402" name="noteref_1402" href="#note_1402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1402</span></span></a> but they objected to the court
of Common Council presuming to dictate to them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the Court of Aldermen had
appointed a committee (24 Sept.) to examine the
question of the right of veto, and this committee had
reported (20 Oct.) in favour of the court.<a id="noteref_1403" name="noteref_1403" href="#note_1403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1403</span></span></a> "We
find," said the committee, "that the court of Common
Council hath always consisted, and still it doth,
of three distinct degrees of persons, viz., of the lord
mayor in the first place as the chefe magistrate,
and secondly of the aldermen as subordinate
magistrates, and thirdly of the commons, or of a
select number of the commons representing all
the commoners of the said city as now is, and
for a long time before hath been used." In
this respect the committee proceeded to say, "the
Common Councill of the city doth much resemble
the constitution of the Common Council of the
kingdom, and we further find that the order of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proceeding in the making of lawes for the good
government of the citty doth imitate the paterne
sett them by the High Court of Parliament, in
making lawes for the government of the nation, in
regard that noe ordinance made in the Common
Councell of this city can be a binding law to any
without the joint consent and concurrence of the
Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen and commoners in
Common Councell assembled, they having a joynt
power and equal authority in making of lawes. So
that the mayor and aldermen cannot impose upon
the commoners, nor <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">e converso</span></span>; each degree having
a power to dissent or assent as to them seems best."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The committee next pointed out how Bills for
the better government of the city had formerly
originated for the most part with the mayor and
aldermen, and had been by them transmitted to the
Common Council, where, after being read in two
several courts (and not twice in one court) and
assented to, they became complete acts and binding
laws. Such had been the usual and salient practice.
Nevertheless, the committee had found that sometimes
the Common Council had petitioned the Court
of Aldermen for redress of certain grievances and the
latter had complied with such petitions, "and so
sometimes Acts of Common Council have been
made at the desire of the lord mayor and aldermen
signifyed to the commons by the Recorder." The
conclusion that the committee arrived at was that
"the lord mayor and aldermen have negative votes
as the commoners also have, and contrary to this
order of proceeding in making Acts of Common
Council wee cannot find any presedent."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 13th November a joint Committee of
Aldermen and Commoners was appointed by the
Common Council to search the city's Records as to
"the respective privileges of the lord mayor and
aldermen and of the commons in Common Council
assembled, and of the most ancient and decent
method in making laws within this citty," and to
report thereon.<a id="noteref_1404" name="noteref_1404" href="#note_1404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1404</span></span></a> Four days later (17 Nov.) the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matters were brought to a crisis on the 12th
March, 1675, when the mayor and aldermen, dissatisfied
with the proceedings of the court of Common
Council, got up and left the court. The Common
Sergeant—the notorious George Jeffreys—refusing to
follow the example set by the Common Sergeant in
1649, remained behind, and went so far as to put a
question to the court of which the mayor and aldermen
had previously disapproved. For this he was
shortly afterwards called to account. His defence
was that he only obeyed the wishes of the majority;
but this being deemed unsatisfactory, the Court of
Aldermen ordered him to be suspended from office.<a id="noteref_1406" name="noteref_1406" href="#note_1406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1406</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He afterwards (23 March) offered an apology to
the Court of Aldermen for his conduct, confessing
"that the question by him put at the last Common

apology, so far as it went, was accepted in good part
by the court, but upon some explanation being asked

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week later (30 March) the Recorder, John

and the Common Sergeant had by command appeared
before his majesty the previous day touching the unhappy
difference existing between the Aldermen and
the Common Council; that the Common Sergeant being
asked to whom it devolved to put the question on a
debate in council, had in the Recorder's hearing
replied to the effect "that the question had always
been used to be put by the lord mayor or by his
lordship's appointment and not otherwise, so far as he
had observed," and he had never known the matter
disputed; that he had then likewise declared to his
majesty that he was "sorry for his deportment at the
last Common Council, saying that what he did was
a sudden act and rashly done without any intention
to make any disturbance, and that he would freely
acknowledge the same wheresoever his majesty
should command him"; that therefore his majesty
had commanded the Recorder to acquaint the court
that the best expedient he could suggest, as the case<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stood, for a settlement of the difficulty, was that the
old order of things should be re-established, that
(among other things) the suspension of the Common
Sergeant should be removed, and that the books and
records of the city should be searched by six such
aldermen as the lord mayor should appoint, and six
such commoners as the Common Council should
appoint, in order to satisfy themselves of the respective
privileges of the lord mayor and aldermen and commons
in Common Council assembled, and to settle
the same in a quiet and peaceable manner if they
could. Failing this his majesty would appoint a
judge to arbitrate in the matter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court followed the king's suggestion so far
as related to the Common Sergeant, and having
listened to his expressions of regret for his late
conduct, and his assurances that he would always
endeavour to "promote the honour and government
of the city," it removed his suspension.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One result of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">contretemps</span></span> which had occurred
in the court of Common Council of the 12th March
was that the Court of Aldermen resolved to retain
certain counsel to advise them as occasion should arise
on the question of their rights and privileges, and to
create a fund by subscription among themselves to
meet the necessary expenses.<a id="noteref_1412" name="noteref_1412" href="#note_1412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1412</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In April the Town Clerk and the four clerks of
the outer court (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> mayor's court) were instructed to
search the books and records of the city on the question
whether or not it was the province of the lord
mayor (1) to direct and put the question in the Common
Council, (2) to name committees, and (3) to
nominate persons to be put in election to any office.<a id="noteref_1413" name="noteref_1413" href="#note_1413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1413</span></span></a>
This last point especially affected the right claimed
by the mayor to nominate (if not to elect) one of the
sheriffs by virtue of his prerogative—a claim which
had already been more than once canvassed and which
was destined shortly to bring the City and the Crown
into violent opposition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime Charles had concluded a separate
treaty with the Dutch (19 Feb., 1674), who
continued to struggle manfully against the French
king, with such assistance as they derived from the
emperor and the German states. The Commons were
fearful of entrusting the king with either money or
troops lest he should employ them against the Dutch,
or against their own liberties. The successes of Louis
at length provoked a general cry for war against
France, and the Commons went so far as to pass a
bill (8 March, 1678) imposing a poll tax as part of the
supply.<a id="noteref_1418" name="noteref_1418" href="#note_1418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1418</span></span></a> Charles lost no time in applying to the City
for the sum of £100,000 on the security of this tax,
and the court of Common Council signified its readiness
to advance the money (9 April).<a id="noteref_1419" name="noteref_1419" href="#note_1419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1419</span></span></a> Finding that
parliament hesitated to furnish the supplies it had
voted, and without which he assured the members he
would have to lay up the fleet and disband some of
the newly raised forces, Charles applied to the City for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name="Pg456" id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
another £50,000. This, too, was granted (14 May);<a id="noteref_1420" name="noteref_1420" href="#note_1420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1420</span></span></a>
and Charles, in order to show his displeasure with the
Commons, resorted to his usual tactics and prorogued
parliament, but only for ten days.<a id="noteref_1421" name="noteref_1421" href="#note_1421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1421</span></span></a> A few days after
the Commons had again met they resolved (27 May)
that if the king would declare war against France they
would give him their hearty support, otherwise they
would at once proceed to take into consideration the
speedy disbandment of the army.<a id="noteref_1422" name="noteref_1422" href="#note_1422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1422</span></span></a> The king refusing
to declare war, parliament proceeded (4 June) to
carry out its threat and voted the sum of £200,000
for the disbandment of all the forces that had been
raised since the 29th September, 1677.<a id="noteref_1423" name="noteref_1423" href="#note_1423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1423</span></span></a> The disbandment
did not take place, however, but in its
stead a force was despatched to Holland. Scarcely
had it arrived before the peace of Nimeguen was
signed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just when the war was brought so unexpectedly
to an end Charles signified his desire for another loan
by the City to the extent of £200,000. The matter
was brought to the notice of the Common Council
on the last day of July, and on the 1st August the
lord mayor issued his precept to the aldermen of the
several wards to invite subscriptions.<a id="noteref_1424" name="noteref_1424" href="#note_1424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1424</span></span></a> For what purpose
the money was required we are not told. It was generally
feared that the king meditated a suppression of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
liberties of his subjects by the introduction of foreign
troops. This fear was enhanced by the knowledge that
if Charles died the crown would fall to his brother, an
uncompromising Catholic. The public mind became
so unhinged that every breath or rumour created the
greatest trepidation. Within a fortnight after the City
had signified its assent to the last loan the nation was
suddenly surprised by some words let drop by Dr.
Tonge, the weak and credulous rector of St. Michael's,
Wood Street, and the tool of the infamous Titus
Oates. A Popish plot was, he said, on foot and the
king's life in danger, in proof of which he produced
documentary evidence. Oates, the prime mover in
starting the idea of a plot, was ready in the most
shameless way with depositions to corroborate all that
Tonge had said. These depositions he made before a
Middlesex magistrate, Sir Edmondesbury Godfrey.
The next morning Godfrey's corpse was found lying
in a ditch near Primrose Hill. All London was wild
with excitement and jumped to the conclusion that
the Middlesex Justice had met a violent death for
listening to Oates's evidence, although there is reason
for believing him to have fallen by his own hands.
The cry against Papists continued unabated for years.<a id="noteref_1425" name="noteref_1425" href="#note_1425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1425</span></span></a>
The city presented the appearance of a state of

with posts and chains, and an armed watch kept by
night and day.<a id="noteref_1426" name="noteref_1426" href="#note_1426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1426</span></span></a> In October, when according to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When parliament met on the 21st of this month
it passed a new Test Act rigidly excluding all Catholics
from both Houses. Five Catholic peers were committed
to the Tower, and Coleman, the secretary of
the Duchess of York, was tried and executed for
having in his possession papers betraying a design for
forcing the Roman Catholic religion on the nation.
It next proceeded to impeach Danby for having been
concerned in certain money transactions between
Charles and the king of France. Knowing the danger
likely to arise from such an investigation, Charles
dissolved (24 Jan., 1679) the parliament, which had
now sat for more than seventeen years.</p>

<a name="toc271" id="toc271"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the elections for the new parliament were
over it was found that the opposition to the king was
greater than ever. Of the city members who had sat
in the last parliament only one—Alderman Love—was
returned, the remaining seats being taken by
Alderman Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Thomas Player, the
city chamberlain, and Thomas Pilkington, afterwards
elected alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without.
This second parliament—the first of a series of short
parliaments—in Charles's reign met on the 6th March,
1679, but was suddenly dissolved on the 27th May
in order to stop the progress of an Exclusion Bill
depriving the Duke of York of his right of succession<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a name="Pg459" id="Pg459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

statute book by passing the Habeas Corpus Act.
It also voted a sum exceeding £200,000 for disbandment
of the forces raised since Michaelmas, 1677.<a id="noteref_1429" name="noteref_1429" href="#note_1429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1429</span></span></a>
Just a week before parliament dissolved the Court of
Aldermen was asked (20 May) to forward an address
thanking both Houses for their care in securing the
personal safety of the king and maintaining the
Protestant religion. The address was referred back
in order to include the king in the vote of thanks, and
was then submitted (23 May) to the Common Council
for approval. That body made a further amendment
by adding the words: "The Protestant religion
according to the doctrine and discipline of the
Church of England as it is now established by law."<a id="noteref_1430" name="noteref_1430" href="#note_1430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1430</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In August the king was confined to his bed with
a fever so violent that it was deemed advisable to
send for his brother the Duke of York. He recovered
however; and on the 11th September a deputation of
city aldermen waited on him to learn when the court
might come in person to congratulate him on his
convalescence.<a id="noteref_1431" name="noteref_1431" href="#note_1431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1431</span></span></a> On the 17th the mayor issued his

The Duke of York did not return to England until
February, 1680, when a special Court of Aldermen sat<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The elections for a fresh parliament which had
taken place in the meantime having gone against the

it was prorogued; and in consequence of repeated

(21 Oct., 1680).<a id="noteref_1434" name="noteref_1434" href="#note_1434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1434</span></span></a> Nor would it in all probability
have been allowed to meet even then, had it not been
for a constant succession of petitions addressed to the
king insisting upon a session being held. So annoyed
was Charles with this demonstration of popular feeling
in favour of parliament that he issued a proclamation
(12 Dec., 1679) prohibiting such "tumultuous
petitions."<a id="noteref_1435" name="noteref_1435" href="#note_1435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1435</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Petitioners</span></em>. On the 29th July
(1680) the Livery assembled in Common Hall for the
election of sheriffs took the opportunity of desiring
Sir Robert Clayton, the lord mayor, to beseech
his majesty on their behalf, that for the preservation
of his royal person and government and the Protestant<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Clayton showed himself very willing to comply
with the wishes of Common Hall, but pointed out
at the same time that he had reason to believe
that parliament was to meet in November. "If that
be so," said he, "I hope your great concern for that
matter might have been spared, being anticipated
by his majesties gracious intention. However, I
shall not be wanting with all humility to lay the
whole matter before him." In spite of Jeffreys, the
Recorder, having ruled that such a petition bordered
on treason, and in spite of a warning received from
the lord chancellor, Clayton insisted on presenting a
petition, and for doing so was rewarded with the
grateful thanks of the Common Council on his quitting
the mayoralty.<a id="noteref_1437" name="noteref_1437" href="#note_1437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1437</span></span></a> Jeffreys on the other hand was

the true Protestant religion, and promised to be ready
at all times to promote his majesty's ease and prosperity,
and to stand by him against all dangers and

address in the spirit with which it was made matters
might have gone better with him, and the Stuart
family might never have been driven from the throne;
but he was in no mood to accept advice either from

the Common Council (13 Jan.) and presented to the
king, in which the petitioners expressed their surprise
at the late prorogation "whereby the prosecution of
the public justice of the kingdom ... have
received an interruption," and after referring to the
action taken by parliament for the defence of his

religion, prayed that the House might be allowed to
resume its session on the day to which parliament had
been prorogued as being "the only means to quiet

the meanwhile it served only to make the king more

it was not however to sit in London, but in the

speech by one of the secondaries, or under-sheriffs,
Henry Cornish, one of the sheriffs, addressed the
meeting and explained how the mayor (Sir Patience
Ward) had been asked to allow himself to be put in
nomination but had declined. One or two aldermen
were nominated for form's sake, but the choice of the
citizens was unanimously in favour of the old members—Sir
Robert Clayton, Alderman Pilkington, Sir
Thomas Player, the city chamberlain, and William
Love. The election over, the Common Hall presented
an address to the members, acknowledging their past
services and promising to support them in their determination
to grant no money supply until they had
effectually secured the city against Popery and arbitrary
power. To this address Sir Robert Clayton
made a brief reply, promising, on behalf of himself
and colleagues, to continue their endeavours to attain
the ends desired. The fact that the new parliament
was to sit at Oxford, a stronghold of the Tory party,
caused no little alarm, and this alarm was increased
when it became known that Charles was bringing his
own guards with him. The city's representatives
were brought on their way by a large number of
followers with ribbons in their hats bearing the words
"No Popery! No Slavery!" whilst Shaftesbury and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles soon perceived that he had little to gain
from the new parliament, which insisted on having its
own way, and refused even the king's humiliating
proposal to place the government of the country
after his demise in the hands of a regent, leaving the
bare title of king to his brother, the Duke of York.
It caused an impeachment to be laid against an Irishman
named Fitzharris whom Charles had recently
removed from Newgate to the Tower in order to
prevent the civic authorities taking the prisoner's
depositions,<a id="noteref_1449" name="noteref_1449" href="#note_1449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1449</span></span></a> and it otherwise proved so uncompromising

published a "declaration" of his reasons for taking

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 13th May the Common Council passed a
vote of thanks to the city members for their faithful

especially in the late parliament at Oxford. It also
agreed by a narrow majority of fourteen to present
an address to the king praying him to cause a

told to meet the king at Hampton Court another
day (19 May). When it was presented the deputation
were told to go home and mind their own business.
Other addresses—one from the lieutenancy of London
and another from the borough of Southwark—presented
the same day, in which thanks were tendered
to his majesty for dissolving the last two parliaments,
met with a very different reception. Undismayed at
the rebuff thus administered to the City, the Grand
Jury at the Old Bailey passed a vote of thanks
(20 May) to the mayor for the part he had taken
in presenting the address, and ordered a similar address
to that of the City to be presented to Charles
on their own account.<a id="noteref_1452" name="noteref_1452" href="#note_1452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1452</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The country seemed to be on the verge of
another civil war. A re-action, however, in favour of
the king set in. The nation began to view the
situation more dispassionately and to entertain serious
doubts whether parliament had acted rightly in pushing
matters to such an extremity. The religious
question after all might not be so important or so
fraught with danger as they had been led to believe
by professional informers. Addresses of the type of
those presented by the lieutenancy of London and the
borough of Southwark, among them being one signed
by over twenty thousand apprentices of the city,<a id="noteref_1453" name="noteref_1453" href="#note_1453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1453</span></span></a>
began to flow in; and proceedings were commenced
against Protestants on no better evidence than had
previously been used against Catholics.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the first against whom proceedings were
taken was a Londoner named Stephen College, a
joiner by trade, who from his zeal in the cause of
religion came to be known as the "Protestant joiner."
An attempt to get a true bill returned against him at
the Old Bailey, where the juries were empanelled by<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, having failed,
he was removed to Oxford and tried there on a charge
of high treason. After much hard swearing a verdict
was at length obtained.<a id="noteref_1454" name="noteref_1454" href="#note_1454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1454</span></span></a></p>

<a name="toc282" id="toc282"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having secured the conviction of College the
council flew at higher game in the person of the Earl
of Shaftesbury. He was arrested at his house in
Aldersgate Street on the 2nd July, but it was not
until November that a bill of high treason was preferred
against him at the Old Bailey. The nomination
of juries practically rested with the sheriffs, and the
court party had recently endeavoured to force the
election of candidates of their own political complexion.
In this they had failed, although in December last
the king had endeavoured to change the character
of city juries by ordering the mayor (Sir Patience
Ward) to issue his precept to the Aldermen to see
that none were returned by their wards for service
on juries "of inferior degree than a subsidy man."<a id="noteref_1455" name="noteref_1455" href="#note_1455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1455</span></span></a>
The sheriffs for the year, Thomas Pilkington and
Samuel Shute, who were zealous Whigs, took care
to empanel a grand jury which would be inclined to
ignore the bill against the earl, and under these
circumstances the bill was thrown out (24 Nov.).<a id="noteref_1456" name="noteref_1456" href="#note_1456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1456</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The failure of the court party to obtain a conviction
of Shaftesbury owing to the political bias of the sheriffs
for the time being, determined them to resort to more
drastic measures to obtain the election of candidates
with Tory proclivities. In order to understand the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg 469]</span><a name="Pg469" id="Pg469" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
method pursued it will be necessary to review briefly
the manner in which the election of sheriffs had from
time to time been carried out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the earliest times of which we have any
city record until the commencement of the 14th century
it had been the custom for the sheriffs of London and
Middlesex to be elected by the mayor, aldermen and
"the good men of the city" or "commonalty."
But a custom sprang up in 1301 of summoning
twelve men only from each ward to take part with
the mayor and aldermen in such elections,<a id="noteref_1457" name="noteref_1457" href="#note_1457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1457</span></span></a> a custom
which found little favour with the bulk of the inhabitants
of the city, who insisted upon being present and taking
part in the proceedings. An attempt was made by
the civic authorities in 1313 to put a stop to the noise
and confusion resulting from the presence of such vast
numbers at the Guildhall by an order providing that
thenceforth only the best men from each ward should
be summoned to take part in the elections, and two
years later (4 July, 1315) this order was enforced by
royal proclamation.<a id="noteref_1458" name="noteref_1458" href="#note_1458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1458</span></span></a> Nevertheless the practice of
summoning representatives from the wards was soon
dropt, and for more than thirty years the sheriffs
continued to be elected by the mayor, aldermen and
the "whole commonalty." Another attempt (made
under Brembre in 1384) to restrict the number of
the commonalty to "so many and such of them as
should seem needful for the time" (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">tantz et tieux

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1347 we meet for the first time with a new

the time being to elect one of the sheriffs continued
to be exercised with few (if any) exceptions down to
1638. Neither in 1639 nor in the following year
was the prerogative exercised. In 1641 the mayor
attempted to exercise it, but through some negligence
on his part was declared by the House of Commons
to have forfeited his right, and the election of both
sheriffs devolved, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pro hac vice</span></span>, upon the commonalty.<a id="noteref_1461" name="noteref_1461" href="#note_1461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1461</span></span></a></p>

being exercised his prerogative in electing as well as
nominating one of the sheriffs, but the commonalty
always challenged his right to elect, although they
paid the mayor the compliment of electing his
nominee to serve with the sheriff of their own choice.
From 1652 to 1660 (or 1661<a id="noteref_1462" name="noteref_1462" href="#note_1462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1462</span></span></a>?) the mayor did
not attempt to exercise a right either of electing or
nominating one of the sheriffs, but in 1662, when the
mayor would have elected as well as nominated
Thomas Bludworth as sheriff, the commonalty claimed
their rights. Bludworth was eventually returned

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now read for the first time in the City's

of sheriffs (although that custom is said to have arisen
in the reign of Elizabeth),<a id="noteref_1466" name="noteref_1466" href="#note_1466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1466</span></span></a> namely, the nomination or
election of a sheriff by the mayor drinking to an individual
at a public banquet. It appears that the
lord mayor had recently drunk to William Roberts,
citizen and vintner, thereby intimating that it was
his lordship's wish that Roberts should be one
of the sheriffs for the year ensuing. The commons
objected to the mayor thus exercising his prerogative,
whilst the aldermen were no less determined to
support him.<a id="noteref_1467" name="noteref_1467" href="#note_1467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1467</span></span></a> The committee to whom the matter

Roberts should be bound over to take upon himself
the office if within the next two or three
years he should be either drunk to by the mayor or
elected by the commons to be sheriff; and that,
further, an Act of Common Council should be forthwith

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Midsummer-day, 1680, the mayor elected
George Hockenhall, citizen and grocer, to be one of
the sheriffs, but Hockenhall refused to serve and was
discharged on his entering into a bond for the
payment of £400. The commons thereupon stept
in and elected Slingsby Bethell, leatherseller, and
Henry Cornish, haberdasher.<a id="noteref_1469" name="noteref_1469" href="#note_1469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1469</span></span></a> At this juncture
political influence was brought to bear upon the
elections. Bethell was particularly an object of
aversion to the court party. He is reported to
have declared himself ready to have acted as executioner
of the late king if no one else could be found
for the job,<a id="noteref_1470" name="noteref_1470" href="#note_1470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1470</span></span></a> and to have made himself obnoxious in
other ways. With Cornish little fault could at
present be found. Objection was raised to both
these gentlemen acting as sheriffs, on the ground
that they had not taken the oath or received the
sacrament as prescribed by law, and another election
demanded. Before this second election took place
(14 July) they had qualified themselves according to
the Corporation Act.<a id="noteref_1471" name="noteref_1471" href="#note_1471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1471</span></span></a> The mayor did not claim his

were put up again for office, and against them two

close it was found that Cornish was at the head with
2,483 votes, Bethell next with 2,276, whilst Box

respectively.<a id="noteref_1473" name="noteref_1473" href="#note_1473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1473</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two first named were declared (29 July)
duly elected. Bethell has been described as a "sullen
and wilful man," a republican at heart and one that
"turned from the ordinary way of a sheriff's living into
the extreme of sordidness." Cornish on the other
hand was "a plain, warm, honest man and lived very
nobly all his year."<a id="noteref_1474" name="noteref_1474" href="#note_1474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1474</span></span></a> It was doubtless Bethell's
proposal that the customary dinner to the aldermen
on the day the new sheriffs were sworn in should be
omitted. If so, Cornish had to give way to the
parsimonious whim of his fellow sheriff. "What an
obstinate man he was!" remarked Cornish of him,
when brought to trial five years later.<a id="noteref_1475" name="noteref_1475" href="#note_1475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1475</span></span></a> The aldermen

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It required some courage for the mayor to again
face the king and his chancellor and to run the risk of
another rebuff. Nevertheless, on Thursday, the 7th
July, the mayor went to Hampton Court, attended
by Sir Robert Clayton, Sir John Shorter and others,
as well as by the sheriffs Bethell and Cornish (the
new sheriffs not coming into office until September),
to present to the king in council another address from
the Common Hall. It was received with no more
favour than the last. The chancellor affected to
believe that it was but the address of a faction in the
city, and not the unanimous vote of the citizens at
large. "The king takes notice there are no aldermen,"
he said, whilst Alderman Clayton and Alderman
Shorter were at his elbow! In fine they were again
told to mind their own business.<a id="noteref_1482" name="noteref_1482" href="#note_1482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1482</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the court party had twice signally
failed to obtain the appointment of sheriffs who
should be amenable to its control, they were fortunate
in having an adherent in the mayor elected on
Michaelmas-day to succeed Sir Patience Ward. The
senior alderman who had not already passed the chair
happened to be Sir John Moore. It does not often
occur that in the choice of a mayor the Common
Hall passes over the senior alderman who is both
capable and willing to take upon himself the office;
but there was some chance of it doing so in this case,
inasmuch as Sir John Moore had rendered himself
unpopular with a large section of citizens by presenting
an address of thanks to the king for the declaration
which his majesty had published in defence of
his having dissolved parliament.<a id="noteref_1483" name="noteref_1483" href="#note_1483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1483</span></span></a> Two aldermen, Sir

recent attitude in the election of sheriffs. The
anomaly by which the citizens of London enjoyed
the right of electing their own sheriffs, as they
had done with short intermissions for the past 500
years, whilst in nearly every county of the kingdom
the sheriffs were nominated by the king, must be
abolished. A writ in the nature of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</span></span>
was accordingly issued to the sheriffs in January,
1682, calling upon them to summon the mayor and
commonalty and citizens of the city to appear in
his majesty's court of King's Bench to answer by
what warrant they claimed divers liberties, franchises
and privileges of which the writ declared they were
impeached.<a id="noteref_1487" name="noteref_1487" href="#note_1487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1487</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notification of service of the writ was formally
made to the Common Council on the 18th January.
The council showed no signs of dismay; they scarcely
realized, perhaps, at the outset the true significance of
the writ or the consequence it was likely to entail.
They had no cause to think that the mayor, commonalty
and citizens had usurped any liberties, franchises
or privileges without due warrant or had
abused any to which they had lawful title. One
thing was plain. It was their duty to maintain the
rights of the City. They therefore appointed a
committee to consult with counsel learned in the
law, and prepare a defence such as they might be
advised to make, and ordered the Chamberlain to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg 478]</span><a name="Pg478" id="Pg478" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disburse such sums of money as might be required

to trial, and in the meantime another severe struggle
took place in assertion of the right claimed by the
citizens to elect both their sheriffs. The citizens
ranged themselves in separate factions, the Whig
party under sheriff Pilkington, the Tories under the

the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Shaftesbury and others

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Duke of York, who had for some time past
resided in Scotland, had not increased in favour
with the citizens of London. It is true that the
mayor and aldermen of the city paid their respects
to his highness (10 April, 1682) at St. James's Palace,
on his return from the north, after paying a similar
visit to the king, who had recently returned to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This election is one of the most remarkable
elections in the City's annals. The royalist mayor,
Sir John Moore, having previously drunk to Dudley
North at a banquet at the Bridge House (18 May),
thereby intimating that he nominated North as one
of the sheriffs for the year ensuing, according to custom,
had issued his precept to the several companies
(19 June) to meet in Common Hall for the purpose
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">confirming</span></em> his nomination and electing another
sheriff to serve with his nominee.<a id="noteref_1496" name="noteref_1496" href="#note_1496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1496</span></span></a> This form of
precept was objected to, and when the Common Cryer
called upon the livery assembled in Common Hall to
appear for the "confirmation" of North, he was met
with cries of "No confirmation! No confirmation!"<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a name="Pg480" id="Pg480" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the rest of his proclamation was drowned in uproar.
"Thereupon," runs the City's Record,<a id="noteref_1497" name="noteref_1497" href="#note_1497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1497</span></span></a> "Thomas
Papillon, esq., mercer, John Du Bois, weaver, and
Ralph Box, grocer, citizens of London (together
with the said Dudley North, so as aforesaid elected
by the lord mayor), were nominated by the commonalty,
that two of them by the said commonalty
might be chosen into the office of sheriffs of the
city of London and county of Middlesex." The
Common Sergeant having declared Papillon and Du
Bois duly elected, a poll was demanded. This was
granted and proceeded with until seven o'clock in
the evening, when the meeting was adjourned by
the mayor until the 27th. The outgoing sheriffs
(Pilkington and Shute), however, disregarded the
mayor's order for adjournment and continued the
poll for some time longer, but at last adjourned the
meeting to the day fixed by the mayor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A fresh question thus arose, namely, whether the
right of adjourning a Common Hall was vested in the
mayor for the time being or in the sheriffs. Sir John
Moore reported the conduct of Pilkington and Shute
to the king's council, with the result that before the

through indisposition, the Recorder declared his lordship's
order that a further adjournment should take
place until the 7th July. The sheriffs again interposed
and asked the Common Hall if it was their wish that
an adjournment should take place, and the answer
being in the negative they proceeded to finish the
poll, with the result that Papillon and Du Bois were
again declared elected by a large majority. Orders
having been given to the Town Clerk to place their
proceedings on record, the Common Hall broke up.<a id="noteref_1499" name="noteref_1499" href="#note_1499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1499</span></span></a></p>

order for a new election had been read, "relation was

citizen and mercer of London, was elected by the
mayor by his prerogative, according to the custom,
into the office of one of the sheriffs of the city of
London and county of Middlesex for the year
ensuing, that another might be associated to him
by the commonalty. And upon this, after declaration
made that the said Dudley North was confirmed
and Thomas Papillon, esq., citizen and mercer of
London, was chosen sheriffs, certain of the commons
demanded that it might be decided by the voices of
the commons between the said Dudley North and
Thomas Papillon and John Du Bois, weaver, and
Ralph Box, grocer (named also by the commonalty),
that the two of those four who should have
the most voices might be the sheriffs elected for the
city of London and county of Middlesex for the
year ensuing. Whereupon the sheriffs and other
officers of the city in the accustomed manner went
into the upper chamber, where declaration of the
premisses was made by the common sergeant to
the mayor and aldermen there sitting; which said
mayor and aldermen, the relation aforesaid well
weighing, did declare the said Dudley North to be
rightly and duly elected and confirmed according to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg 483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the law and custom of the said city, and immediately
came down upon the place where the Court
of Hustings is usually held, and there, in their
presence and by their command, the said Dudley
North was solemnly called to come forth and give
his consent to take upon him the said office.<a id="noteref_1502" name="noteref_1502" href="#note_1502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1502</span></span></a> And
the said lord mayor did then direct that the poll
should be taken only for the said Thomas Papillon,
John Du Bois and Ralph Box, by certain persons
thereunto particularly appointed by the said lord
mayor, that one of those three who had the most
voices might be associated to the said Dudley North.
And afterwards the said mayor and aldermen
departed out of the hall. And the poll for the
said three persons last named was immediately
begun, and continued until the evening of that day.
And then the said congregation was, by order of the
lord mayor, adjourned until the next day, being
Saturday, the 15th of July aforesaid, at 9 o'clock in
the afternoon [<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sic.</span></span>]. At which day the said poll
being continued was in the afternoon of that day
finished. And thereupon relation was made by the
common sergeant to the mayor and aldermen that
upon the poll taken by the severall persons appointed
by the said lord mayor as aforesaid, there
were 60 voices for Mr. Papillon, 60 voices for Mr.
Du Bois, and 1,244 voices for Mr. Box. By which
it appeared that the said Ralph Box had the most
voices, and so was elected into the office of one of
the sheriffs of the city of London and county of
Middlesex for the year ensuing. And the same in
the afternoon was so declared by the common<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a name="Pg484" id="Pg484" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sergeant to the commons then and there assembled,
which said election of the said Ralph Box was by
the aforesaid mayor, aldermen and commonalty
ratified and confirmed. And thereupon, according
to the form and effect of the Act of Common Council
in that case made and provided, publication
thereof by proclamation being then made in the
place where the Hustings Court is usually held in
the presence of the said lord mayor, aldermen and
sheriffs, the said Ralph Box was then and there
solemnly called, etc."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very different is the account of the proceedings
as given us in a tract of the day.<a id="noteref_1503" name="noteref_1503" href="#note_1503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1503</span></span></a> From the latter
we learn that a separate poll was opened the same
day by the sheriffs, in which all four candidates
were submitted to the choice of the citizens, and
the result of which was declared by Sheriff Pilkington
on the 15th, prior to the mayor's declaration.
According to this poll, Papillon and Du Bois were
again returned at the head with 2,487 and 2,481
votes respectively. There were only 107 in favour
of confirming North's election, whilst 2,414 gave
their votes against it. Box found himself with
only 173 supporters. It was after the declaration of
this result that the mayor ordered the common
sergeant to declare the result of the other poll, but
the declaration of the large number of votes alleged
to have been given in favour of Box caused so much
uproar that he could proceed no further. The mayor
and aldermen thereupon left the hall, and Papillon and
Du Bois were declared by the sheriffs duly elected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was expected that Box would attend before
the next Court of Aldermen to be held on the 18th
July to give bond for holding office as North had
already done, but he failed to appear. A petition,
therefore, was presented to the court praying that
as Papillon and Du Bois had been elected sheriffs the
court should call them forth according to custom.
The mayor being advised to postpone giving an
answer, another petition to the same effect was presented
at the next court (20 July), whilst yet a third
prayed that a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caveat</span></span> might be entered against North
and Box being admitted and sworn sheriffs. The
mayor was again advised to take time to consider his
answer.<a id="noteref_1504" name="noteref_1504" href="#note_1504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1504</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week later (27 July) the mayor made the
following reply to the petitioners, by advice of the
court:—"Gentlemen, this court hath considered of
your petition, and will take care that such persons
shall take the office of sheriffs upon them as are duly
elected according to law and the ancient customs
of this city; and in this and all other things this
court will endeavour to maintain the rights and

wherein you think that we do otherwise the law

dismissed.<a id="noteref_1506" name="noteref_1506" href="#note_1506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1506</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the matter was allowed to rest until the

again prayed that Papillon and Du Bois might be
called upon to enter into bond according to custom.
The only answer returned was that Box, who in the
opinion of the court had been duly elected one of the
sheriffs, had been discharged from service on payment
of a fine, and that another election would shortly
take place. Thereupon murmurs arose. There had
been too many Common Halls already over this
affair, cried some, and their choice of sheriffs had been
made. The mayor bade them begone in the king's
name, or they would be looked upon as tumultuous.<a id="noteref_1507" name="noteref_1507" href="#note_1507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1507</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court sat again on the 12th September, when,
we are told, a petition similar to those before presented
being again brought forward, a debate arose which
occasioned some sharp words, and the mayor ordered
the sword to be taken up and so dissolved the court;
but nothing of this is recorded in the minutes of the
court.<a id="noteref_1508" name="noteref_1508" href="#note_1508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1508</span></span></a> Two days later (14 Sept.), several petitions

made as had been given to the petitioners of the 27th
July. The petitioners were further told that it was
the mayor's intention to call a Common Hall on
Tuesday, the 19th September, to elect one to serve
in the place of Box.<a id="noteref_1510" name="noteref_1510" href="#note_1510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1510</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When that day arrived and the common sergeant,
acting on instructions from the mayor, put forward the
name of Peter Rich, there arose repeatedly the cry of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a name="Pg487" id="Pg487" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
"No Rich!" and such a din followed, the citizens declaring
loudly that they would stand by their old choice,
that nothing else could be heard. At length the sheriffs
were given to understand that a poll was demanded.
The mayor hearing of the proposed poll thereupon
came on to the hustings and declared Rich to be duly
elected. The whole business was carried on in dumb
show, it being impossible to hear anything that was said.
Having done this, the mayor dissolved the Common
Hall and went home. The sheriff proceeded nevertheless
to open the poll in the afternoon, with the result
that 2,082 votes were found in favour of standing by
their old choice, whilst only thirty-five were for
Rich. Hearing that the mayor was returning, the
sheriffs made a hurried declaration of the result of
the poll, proclaiming Papillon and Du Bois to have
been again elected, and dismissed the assembly.
The mayor on his arrival caused the gates of the
Guildhall to be closed. Such is the account of
what took place on the 19th September, as given
by the diarist of the day.<a id="noteref_1511" name="noteref_1511" href="#note_1511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1511</span></span></a> The City's Journal merely

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day (20 Sept.) the lord mayor and a
deputation of aldermen waited on the king at Whitehall,
and informed him of what had taken place. A
council was thereupon summoned for that afternoon,
which the sheriffs were ordered to attend. Upon their
appearance they were told that they had behaved in
a riotous manner, and must answer for their conduct
before the King's Bench.  They were accordingly<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a name="Pg488" id="Pg488" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made to enter into their own recognisances severally
for £1,000, besides finding other security.<a id="noteref_1513" name="noteref_1513" href="#note_1513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1513</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 26th, when Rich was called before the
Court of Aldermen to enter into bond to take office,
a paper was handed to the court desiring that Papillon
and Du Bois might be called to the shrievalty, but
it was to no purpose. The same answer was returned
as on previous occasions.<a id="noteref_1514" name="noteref_1514" href="#note_1514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1514</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days later (28 Sept.) Rich and North were
sworn into office amid a great concourse of citizens
at the Guildhall, the entrance to which was strongly
guarded by a company of trained bands in case of
disturbance. When the oath was about to be administered
to them a protest was made by Papillon and
Du Bois, who attempted to get possession of the
book; but upon the lord mayor commanding them
in the king's name to depart and keep the peace,
they left the hall and with them went several of
the aldermen who were their supporters. The new
sheriffs entertained the mayor and aldermen, according
to custom, at Grocers' Hall, Rich being a member of
that company.<a id="noteref_1515" name="noteref_1515" href="#note_1515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1515</span></span></a> Rich subsequently applied for and was
allowed the sum of £100 out of the fine of £400 paid
into the Chamber by Box.<a id="noteref_1516" name="noteref_1516" href="#note_1516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1516</span></span></a> The election which had
been so long and so hotly contested thus ended in a
complete victory for the court party.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the custom in those days, as it is now, for
members of the livery company or companies to
which a newly-elected sheriff belonged to accompany<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page489">[pg 489]</span><a name="Pg489" id="Pg489" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him to the Guildhall on the occasion of his entering
upon his office. Dudley North, being a member of
the Mercers' Company, had desired the officers of the
company and several of the livery to pay him this
compliment, but after considering the matter the
court of the company passed a resolution to the
effect that neither officers nor members should attend
him on pain of being expelled from the company, but
that they should accompany Papillon to the hall and
present him to be sworn as one of the sheriffs.<a id="noteref_1517" name="noteref_1517" href="#note_1517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1517</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornish attended the ceremony at the Guildhall,
and afterwards (2 Oct.) swore an information before
Sir William Turner,<a id="noteref_1518" name="noteref_1518" href="#note_1518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1518</span></span></a> a brother alderman, of the
treatment he had received at the hands of the
soldiers present. The information was to the effect
that when he and several other aldermen entered the
hall about nine o'clock in the morning they found a
guard of soldiers placed at the hall door, and another
drawn up before the hustings, "who were presently
commanded by their officer to stand to their armes."
After a short stay in the Council Chamber they
returned into the hall to meet the lord mayor, and
for a quarter of an hour walked up and down the hall
"betweene the clock-house and the doore w<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ch</span></span> leads
up to the Hustings Court on the north side of
the hall." Hitherto they had met with no opposition
from the soldiers, but now they were accosted
by Lieutenant-Colonel Quiney, the officer in command,
who desired "they would give him noe
disturbance." To this they replied that "they would<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg 490]</span><a name="Pg490" id="Pg490" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
give him none and expected alsoe not to bee themselves
disturbed by anie in that place." Quiney
thereupon left, but soon after returned and told them
he had orders from the lieutenancy to clear the hall.
He was asked to produce the order, and if it were
found to include aldermen of the city Cornish and
his friends would obey. The order was not forthcoming;
it was with the major, said Quiney, who
soon afterwards formed up his men and, again
addressing Cornish and the other aldermen, peremptorily
required them to withdraw or he would expel
them by force. Cornish again demanded to see the
order, but the officer forthwith laid hands on him
and thrust him out, declaring that he would abide by
the order of the lieutenancy, who were his masters.
So ends Cornish's information. Proceedings were
subsequently taken against Quiney for keeping persons
that were liverymen out of the Guildhall and
offering abuse to others.<a id="noteref_1519" name="noteref_1519" href="#note_1519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1519</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day being Michaelmas-day a Common
Hall met to elect a mayor for the ensuing year in the
place of Sir John Moore.<a id="noteref_1520" name="noteref_1520" href="#note_1520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1520</span></span></a> Four aldermen were
nominated as candidates, viz., Sir William Pritchard,
the senior alderman below the chair, Sir Henry Tulse,
Sir Thomas Gold and Henry Cornish. The common
sergeant having declared that the choice of the
citizens lay between Pritchard and Gold, a poll was
demanded and allowed, the result of which was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page491">[pg 491]</span><a name="Pg491" id="Pg491" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
declared (4 Oct.) to be as follows:—Gold 2,289,
Cornish 2,259, Pritchard 2,233 and Tulse 236.<a id="noteref_1521" name="noteref_1521" href="#note_1521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1521</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This result seems to have satisfied no one, and a
scrutiny was asked for in order that the poll books
might be compared with the lists of liverymen of
the several companies. It was discovered that certain
members of the livery of the Merchant Taylors' and
other companies had recorded their votes although
they had not taken the liveryman's oath prescribed
by such companies. The question of the legality of
such votes being submitted to the Court of Aldermen,
that body decided (24 Oct.) against the voters.<a id="noteref_1522" name="noteref_1522" href="#note_1522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1522</span></span></a> The
election was watched with anxious interest. Pritchard,
himself a Merchant Taylor, was known to be of the
same political mind as the out-going mayor, and it
was the common belief at the time that if the
majority of votes should prove to be in favour of
Gold or Cornish, who were of the Whig party, the
king would interpose and continue Sir John Moore in
office for another year.<a id="noteref_1523" name="noteref_1523" href="#note_1523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1523</span></span></a> His majesty had recently
been amusing himself at Newmarket, but he had
been kept posted up in city news, and immediately
after his return to Whitehall was waited on by the
mayor and aldermen (22 Oct.) and informed of the
state of affairs. The result of the scrutiny, according
to the paper submitted to the Court of Aldermen,
was still in favour of Gold and Cornish, but according
to the return made by the mayor<a id="noteref_1524" name="noteref_1524" href="#note_1524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1524</span></span></a> (25 Oct.) Pritchard<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page492">[pg 492]</span><a name="Pg492" id="Pg492" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was placed at the head of the poll with 2,138 votes,
as against 2,124 for Gold, 2,093 for Cornish and 236
for Tulse. The first two named were therefore
presented to the Court of Aldermen for them to
choose one to be mayor according to custom, and
their choice falling upon Pritchard he was declared
elected, and on the following feast of SS. Simon and
Jude (28 Oct.) was admitted and sworn.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time was thought opportune by the Duke of
York for prosecuting his action for slander against
Pilkington commenced in June last. The words
complained of, and for which the duke claimed
damages to the extent of £50,000, were declared on
the oath of two aldermen—Sir Henry Tulse and Sir
William Hooker—to have been spoken by him at a
Court of Aldermen at a time when that body was
about to visit the duke to congratulate him upon his
return from Scotland, and were to the effect that the
duke had burnt the city and was then coming to cut
their throats. That the words, if spoken—a question
open to much doubt—were scandalous to a degree
cannot be denied, but the claim for damages was none
the less vindictive. Instead of laying his action in
London the duke caused his action to be tried by a
jury of the county of Hertford (24 Nov.). Pilkington
made very little defence (he probably thought it
useless), and the jury awarded the duke the full<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg 493]</span><a name="Pg493" id="Pg493" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
amount of damages claimed. The ex-sheriff was of

recently been called to account for moneys received),
Slingsby Bethell, and others were brought to trial
for the disturbance that had taken place last Midsummer-day.
The trial was opened at the Guildhall
on the 16th February, but the jury being challenged
on the ground that the array contained no peer
(a peer of the realm being about to be tried), the
challenge was allowed, and the trial put off until
the next term. On the 8th May, after a long trial,
all the accused were found guilty, and were eventually
(26 June) fined in various sums, amounting in all to
£4,100.<a id="noteref_1528" name="noteref_1528" href="#note_1528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1528</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime, having experienced so much
difficulty in bending the City to his will, and having
so far succeeded in his object as to have a royalist
mayor in the chair, as well as royalist sheriffs, Charles
took steps to obtain an equally subservient Common
Council. To this end he had issued a command
(18 Dec.) to the mayor to enforce on the electors
at the coming feast of St. Thomas (21 Dec.) the
obligation of electing only such men to be members
of the new council as had conformed with the provisions
of the Corporation Act. The king's letter
was by the mayor's precept read at each wardmote
on the day of election.<a id="noteref_1530" name="noteref_1530" href="#note_1530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1530</span></span></a> It was hoped that by this

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The design failed and the king resolved at length

of more than a twelvemonth the trial came on for
hearing (7 Feb., 1683). The solicitor-general, who
opened the case, propounded to the court four
questions: (1) Whether any corporation could be
forfeited? (2) Whether the city of London differed
from other corporations as to point of forfeiture?
(3) Whether any act of the mayor, aldermen and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a name="Pg495" id="Pg495" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Common Council in Common Council assembled be
so much the act of the Corporation as could make a
forfeiture? and (4) Whether the acts by them done

by it,<a id="noteref_1532" name="noteref_1532" href="#note_1532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1532</span></span></a> or in making the petition of the 13th January,
1681, and causing it to be published, be such acts as,
if done by the Corporation, would make a forfeiture of
the Corporation? After a lengthy argument counsel
for the Crown concluded by asking judgment for the
king, and that the defendants might be ousted of their
franchise as a Corporation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City's Recorder, Sir George Treby, rose in
reply. His argument in favour of the City<a id="noteref_1533" name="noteref_1533" href="#note_1533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1533</span></span></a> tended to
show that the corporation of London <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">quâ</span></span> corporation
could not forfeit its existence either by voluntary
surrender or by abuse of its powers, much less could
its existence be imperilled by the action of those
representatives of the city to whom its government
had been confided. The corporation of the City was
a governing body elected for specific purposes; if it
proceeded <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ultra vires</span></span> to establish market tolls or to
offer a petition to the king which was seditious, an
indictment lay against every particular member of
that body, but no execution could be taken against
the mayor, commonalty and citizens of London, a
body politic that is invisible, one that can neither see
nor be seen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Counsel on the other side had laid stress on the fact
that the liberties and franchises of the City had been
often seized or "taken into the king's hands," adducing
instances with which the reader of the earlier<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page496">[pg 496]</span><a name="Pg496" id="Pg496" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pages of this work will be already familiar; and if
they could be so seized, they could also be forfeited.
The Recorder argued that this conclusion was a wrong
one. The effect of the seizure of the City's liberties
in former days had only been to place the government
of the city in the hands of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">custos</span></span> or warden. The
Corporation continued as before; it might sue and be
sued as before; it was neither suspended nor destroyed.
How could the king seize a Corporation?
Could he himself constitute the mayor, commonalty
and citizens of a city, or make anyone else such?
No, a Corporation was not, to use a legal phrase,
"manurable"; it could not be seized; nor had anyone
(he believed) ever imagined such a thing as a
dissolution of a corporation by a judgment in law
until that day. At the conclusion of his speech the
further hearing of the case was adjourned until April.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the resumption of the hearing (27 April)<a id="noteref_1534" name="noteref_1534" href="#note_1534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1534</span></span></a>
Sir Robert Sawyer, the attorney-general, at whose
suggestion and by whose authority the writ against
the City had been issued, took up the argument, commencing
his speech with an attempt to allay the apprehension
excited by the prospect of forfeiture of the
City's charter. "It was not the king's intention," he
said, "to demolish at once all their liberties and to
lay waste and open the city of London, and to
reduce it to the condition of a country village," as
some had maliciously reported, but to amend the
government of the City "by running off those
excesses and exorbitances of power which some<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page497">[pg 497]</span><a name="Pg497" id="Pg497" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men (contrary to their duty and the known laws of
the land) have assumed to themselves under colour
of their corporate capacity, to the reviling of their
prince, the oppression of their fellow subjects and
to the infinite disquiet of their fellow citizens."<a id="noteref_1535" name="noteref_1535" href="#note_1535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1535</span></span></a>
History had shown that the City had never been
better governed than when it was in the king's hands.
Its ancient customs had not been destroyed, but
only restrained in subordination to the general government
of the kingdom, and therefore the danger now
threatened would not prove so fatal to the City as had
been suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the conclusion of the arguments on both
sides, nearly three months were allowed to pass before
judgment was given, in the hope that the citizens of
London might follow the example set by Norwich,
Evesham and other boroughs, and freely surrender
their charter. "I do believe nobody here wishes
this case should come to judgment," was the remark
made by Chief Justice Saunders at the conclusion of
the hearing; but at length the patience of the Crown
or of the judges was exhausted, and judgment was
pronounced (12 June) by Justice Jones in the absence
of the Lord Chief Justice, who was now on the point
of death. Briefly, the judgment pronounced was to
the effect (1) that a corporation aggregate might be
seized; (2) that exacting and taking money by a
"pretended" by-law was extortion and a forfeiture
of franchise; (3) that the petition was scandalous and
libellous, and the making and publishing it a forfeiture;
(4) that an Act of Common Council is an Act of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg 498]</span><a name="Pg498" id="Pg498" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Corporation; (5) that the matter set forth in the
record did not excuse or avoid those forfeitures set
forth in the replication, and (6) that the information
was well founded. The result of these findings was
that the franchise of the Corporation was ordered to
be seized into the king's hands, but this judgment was
not to be entered until the king's pleasure should be
known. As to the right claimed by the citizens to
have and constitute sheriffs (a right which they had
recently shown no disposition to forego) and the claim
of the mayor and aldermen to be Justices of the
Peace and to hold Sessions, the attorney-general
was content to enter a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nolle prosequi</span></span>.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days before delivery of judgment the
Common Council agreed to expunge from the records
of the court all minutes of proceedings during the late
civil war that in any way reflected upon the late king.<a id="noteref_1536" name="noteref_1536" href="#note_1536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1536</span></span></a>
The list of the various minutes thus ordered to be
annulled was a very long one, occupying more than
ten pages of the city's Journal, and embraced a period
of eighteen years (1641-1659). The municipal authorities
may have thought that by this egregious act
of self-stultification they might mitigate the judgment
that was impending over them. If so they were
sadly mistaken.</p>

command or direct. Accordingly, on Monday the

accompanied by a deputation of aldermen and
members of the Common Council, to lay this petition
before the king in council, and his majesty's reply,
given by the mouth of the lord keeper, was reported
to the Common Council on the following Wednesday.<a id="noteref_1538" name="noteref_1538" href="#note_1538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1538</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king, he said, had been very loth to take
action against the City, but had been driven to do so
by the recent elections. Their petition would
have been more gracious if presented earlier; nevertheless,
his majesty would not reject it on that
account. He would, however, show the City as
much favour as could be reasonably expected. It
was not his intention to prejudice them either in
their properties or customs, and he had instructed
Mr. Attorney not to enter judgment lest such a
proceeding might entail serious consequences. The
alterations he required were few and easy. They
were these, viz., that no mayor, sheriff, recorder,
common sergeant, town clerk or coroner of the city
of London or any steward of the borough of Southwark
should be appointed without his majesty's approval
under his sign manual; that if his majesty should
express disapproval of the choice of a mayor made by
the citizens a new election should take place within
a week, and if his majesty should disapprove of the
second choice he shall, if he so please, himself
nominate a mayor for the year ensuing; that if his
majesty should in like manner disapprove of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg500" id="Pg500" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
persons chosen to be sheriffs, or either of them, he
shall, if he please, proceed to appoint sheriffs by his
commission, but subject to this restriction the election
of these officers might take according to the ancient
usuage of the city; that the lord mayor and Court of
Aldermen might with leave of his majesty displace
any alderman, recorder, common sergeant, town
clerk, coroner of the city or steward of Southwark;
that where an election of an alderman had been set
aside by the Court of Aldermen another election
should be held, and that the Justices of the Peace
should be by his majesty's commission. These
terms accepted by the citizens, his majesty would
consent to confirm their charter in a manner consistent
with them. But if they were not speedily
complied with his majesty had given orders to
enter up judgment by the Saturday following, and
any consequences that might follow would be at the
door of the citizens themselves.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A "long and serious" debate, we are told,
followed the reading of this answer in the Common

whether the court should submit to the king's terms
or not, with the result that 104 votes were recorded
in favour of accepting them as against 85 votes

his fellow-prisoners made their way home. A cry
that the Whigs had seized the mayor and carried him
off caused great consternation, and the trained bands

Among the minor conspirators were two men who
had been employed by Broom, the city coroner, in
the recent arrest of the lord mayor. Broom himself
was suspected of being implicated in the conspiracy,
and was on that ground ordered into custody for the
purpose of being examined by a justice of the peace.
In the meantime he was to be suspended from his

laid before the Common Council drafts of a surrender

prepared for their acceptance. After long debate the
opinion of the Attorney-general, the Solicitor-general,
and the Recorder was taken upon the following
questions, viz., (1) Whether the surrender was agreeable
to the submission of the Common Council
already made and necessary for the regulations

the office of mayoralty was surrendered; (3) if
so, whether the customs and prescriptions belonging

ready.<a id="noteref_1550" name="noteref_1550" href="#note_1550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1550</span></span></a> Two of them, viz., that of the Attorney-general
and that of the Solicitor-general were decidedly
in favour of the City surrendering its liberties in preference
to allowing judgment to be entered up. The
Recorder took a diametrically opposite view of the
matter, one of the reasons urged by him against a
surrender being that such action would be against
their oaths, and that if they freely surrendered their
liberties there would be no redress left open to them.
If, on the other hand, they suffered judgment to be
entered up, they could take proceedings against it by
writ of error. These opinions gave rise to much
debate, and many hard things were spoken against the
Recorder. At last the matter was put to the vote,
when 103 were found against sealing the deed of
surrender as against 85 who were in favour of it; and
so this momentous question was settled, and the
council broke up at eleven o'clock at night.<a id="noteref_1551" name="noteref_1551" href="#note_1551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1551</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judgment was forthwith (4 Oct.) entered against
the City. The mayor and the new sheriffs were
summoned to attend the king. Pritchard received a

similar commissions were handed to the new sheriffs.
The Recorder was dismissed and his place given to Sir

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus reduced the Corporation of the city
to submission, Charles proceeded to take similar action
against the livery companies, with the object of getting
into his own hands the power of appointing and dismissing
their governing body. Seeing that opposition
was useless, they submitted with the best grace they
could, surrendering their former charters and receiving
new charters in their place. The first master, wardens
and assistants were usually named in these new charters,
which provided (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inter alia</span></span>) that they should be
removable at the king's pleasure by Order in Council,
that they should take the oaths of allegiance and
supremacy and make the declaration prescribed by
the Corporation Act, that none should be elected
members who were not of the Church of England,
and that in all things concerning the government of
the city they should be subject to the mayor and
aldermen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"They will never kill me, James, to make you
king," the late king is said to have cynically remarked
to his brother; and, indeed, the accession of the
Duke of York was accepted by the nation in general,
as well as by the City of London in particular, with
considerable foreboding. The new king for a short
while was content to feel his way before plunging
into the headstrong course of action which eventually
lost him the crown. Although suspected of being a
Catholic at heart, it was only during his last moments
that Charles had accepted the ministrations of the
Roman Church. The new king had for years been an
avowed Catholic; nevertheless, in his first speech to
the Privy Council he announced his intention of
maintaining the established government, both in
Church and State. This speech, made within an hour
of the late king's death, was received with rapturous
applause. It was quickly followed by a proclamation
of his majesty's wish that all persons in office at the
time of the decease of the late king should so continue
until further notice.<a id="noteref_1556" name="noteref_1556" href="#note_1556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1556</span></span></a> Another document proclaiming
the death of the late king and the devolution of the

drawn up by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, with
the assistance of the privy council, the mayor,
aldermen and citizens of London and others.<a id="noteref_1557" name="noteref_1557" href="#note_1557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1557</span></span></a> This<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a name="Pg507" id="Pg507" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James had not been many days on the throne
before the question of supply had to be settled.
More than one-half of the whole revenue of the
crown was derived from the customs, and these had
been settled on Charles for life only, and could not
therefore be exacted by his successor without the
assent of parliament. No parliament had been
summoned since the dissolution of the parliament at
Oxford four years since (28 March, 1681). As time
was pressing and some delay must have taken place
before a new parliament could meet, James took the
advice of Chief Justice Jeffreys, and did violence to
the constitution by proclaiming (9 Feb.) the continuation
of the payment of customs as a matter of
necessity, whilst at the same time he intimated his
intention of speedily calling a parliament.<a id="noteref_1558" name="noteref_1558" href="#note_1558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1558</span></span></a> The pill
thus gilded was swallowed without protest. The
excise duties was another matter and was dealt
with differently. The "additional excise," like the
customs, had been given to the late king for life, but
there was a clause in the Act which empowered
the Lords of the Treasury to let them to farm for a
term of three years without any limitation as to their
being so long due. A lease was now propounded as
having been made during the late king's life (the
document bearing date the 5th February, the day
preceding his decease), although there was every
reason for supposing it to have been made after his
death and to have been post-dated. The judges were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page508">[pg 508]</span><a name="Pg508" id="Pg508" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appealed to, and with every desire to curry favour
with the new king, the majority pronounced the
document to be good in law. Thus fortified, James
no longer hesitated to issue a proclamation (16 Feb.)
for the continuation of the excise.<a id="noteref_1559" name="noteref_1559" href="#note_1559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1559</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A parliament was summoned for the 9th April,
but did not meet until the 19th May. In the meantime
the king and queen had been crowned at
Westminster on St. George's day (23 April). The
City put in their customary claim,<a id="noteref_1560" name="noteref_1560" href="#note_1560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1560</span></span></a> but this was at
first disallowed "in regard of the judgment upon the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</span></span> for seizure of the cities franchise."
Upon appeal being made, however, to the king himself
the claim was allowed, and the mayor, aldermen
and citizens were treated with high honour both in
the Abbey and at the banquet in Westminster Hall,
the mayor being presented by the king with the cup
of pure gold and cover, weighing in all upwards of
twenty ounces, with which he had served his majesty
with wine.<a id="noteref_1561" name="noteref_1561" href="#note_1561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1561</span></span></a> A few days before the banquet took
place Sir Robert Vyner sent to the mayor to borrow
the City's plate for the occasion. The matter was
laid before the Court of Aldermen and permission
was granted the lord mayor to lend such plate as
could be spared.<a id="noteref_1562" name="noteref_1562" href="#note_1562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1562</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When parliament met (19 May) the majority in
favour of the court party was enormous. This was in
no small measure due to the reformation that had
been forced on other corporate towns besides the city
of London. They had been made to surrender their<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a name="Pg509" id="Pg509" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
charters, and the late king had in return granted
them new charters in which Tories alone were named
as members of the corporations. Only one more
step was necessary in order to secure the return of a
Tory parliament when the time for fresh elections
should arrive, and that step was taken. The parliamentary
franchise in boroughs was restricted to
members of the corporations.<a id="noteref_1563" name="noteref_1563" href="#note_1563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1563</span></span></a> In London the Whigs
were kept down by fear, and the Tory party reigned
supreme. The mayor and half the Court of Aldermen
were nominees of the Crown, acting by royal commission.
No Common Council sat, or if it did it
was only for the purpose of enrolling a proclamation
by the king or a precept by the mayor. As the
election drew near the king, in order to render the
result in his favour more sure, authorized the Court
of Aldermen to grant liveries to several of the city
companies, taking care that such only should be
admitted to the livery as were of "unquestionable
loyalty" for the purpose of voting.<a id="noteref_1564" name="noteref_1564" href="#note_1564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1564</span></span></a> By this means
four of the most pronounced Tories in the city
were returned, all of them being aldermen. These
were Sir John Moore and Sir William Pritchard,
both of whom had been placed in the mayoralty
chair, one after the other (in 1681 and 1682), by
court influence, Sir Peter Rich, who had served as
sheriff with Dudley North in 1682, and Sir Samuel
Dashwood, who filled the same office the following
year with Peter Daniel, both of them, like their
immediate predecessors, being nominees of the Crown.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page510">[pg 510]</span><a name="Pg510" id="Pg510" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
As soon as the House met the Commons unanimously
granted the king the full revenue which had been
enjoyed by his brother.<a id="noteref_1565" name="noteref_1565" href="#note_1565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1565</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bent of the king's mind was quickly discerned
in the sentences pronounced by judges eager
to secure his favour. Titus Oates was taken out of
prison and whipt at the cart's tail from Aldgate to
Newgate the day after parliament met. Two days
later he was again whipt from Newgate to Tyburn,
and the punishment was so mercilessly carried out
that it nearly cost him his life. Precautions had to
be taken by the mayor to prevent a display of force
by Oates's partisans, who overturned the pillory on
which he was to stand.<a id="noteref_1566" name="noteref_1566" href="#note_1566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1566</span></span></a> Dangerfield, another professional
informer, was made to undergo a punishment
scarcely less severe. He survived the punishment,
but only to die from the effect of a vicious blow dealt
him by a bystander as he was being carried back to
gaol from Tyburn.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand Richard Baxter—the most
learned and moderate of Nonconformists—was tried
at the Guildhall on a charge of having introduced into
his commentary on the New Testament some seditious
remarks respecting the attitude of the government
towards dissenters. The infamous Jeffreys presided
at the trial, and spared neither counsel nor prisoner
his insolent invectives. The whole proceedings were
nothing less than a farce, and the evidence adduced
was of such a flimsy character that Baxter volunteered
a remark expressing a doubt whether any jury would
convict a man on it. He was, however, mistaken.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page511">[pg 511]</span><a name="Pg511" id="Pg511" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The sheriffs, like the mayor, were but tools of the
court party, and the jurymen selected to sit on the
trial did not hesitate to bring in a verdict of guilty. He
was fortunate to get off with no worse sentence than a
fine of 500 marks and imprisonment until it was paid.<a id="noteref_1567" name="noteref_1567" href="#note_1567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1567</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was doubtless a large number of inhabitants
of the city who would gladly have assisted
Monmouth—"the champion of the dissenters and
extreme Protestants"—had they been in a position
to do so. But as soon as the news of the duke's
landing in Dorsetshire reached London orders were
issued by the mayor for a strict watch to be kept by
night throughout the city, and for the arrest of all
suspicious characters, whilst the duke and his supporters
were proclaimed traitors and rebels. It was
forbidden to circulate the duke's manifesto in the
city, and on the 16th June, or within five days of his
landing, a price of £5,000 was put upon his head.<a id="noteref_1568" name="noteref_1568" href="#note_1568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1568</span></span></a>
After Monmouth's defeat at Sedgmoor (6 July) he
and his companions sought safety in flight. Monmouth
himself fled to the New Forest, where he was
captured in the last stage of poverty, sleeping in
a ditch, and was brought to London. He was lodged
in the Tower, where his wife and three children had
already been sent. Thousands of spectators, who,
we are told, "seemed much troubled," went forth to
witness his arrival by water on the evening of the
13th July. Two days later he was executed on
Tower Hill.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The utmost cruelty, both military and judicial,
was inflicted on Monmouth's supporters. Many were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg 512]</span><a name="Pg512" id="Pg512" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hanged by royalist soldiers—"Kirke's lambs," as
they were called—without form of law. Others
were committed for trial until Jeffreys came to hold
his "Bloody Assize," when to the cruelty of the
sentences passed on most of them was added the
ribald insolence of the judge. The opportunity was
taken of giving the city of London a lesson, and
Henry Cornish, late alderman and sheriff, was
suddenly arrested. This took place on Tuesday the
13th October. He was kept a close prisoner, not
allowed to see friends or counsel, and deprived of
writing materials. On Saturday he was informed for
the first time that he would be tried on a charge of
high treason, and that the trial would commence on
the following Monday (19 Oct.). His attitude before
the judges was calm and dignified. Before pleading
not guilty to the charge of having consented to aid
and abet the late Duke of Monmouth and others in
their attempt on the life of the late king (the Rye
House Plot), he entered a protest against the indecent
haste with which he had been called upon to
plead and the short time allowed him to prepare his
case. He asked for further time, but this the judges
refused.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the chief witnesses for the Crown was
Goodenough, who had a personal spite against
Cornish for his having objected to him (Goodenough)
serving as under-sheriff in 1680-1, the year when
Bethell and Cornish were sheriffs.<a id="noteref_1569" name="noteref_1569" href="#note_1569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1569</span></span></a> Goodenough
had risked his neck in Monmouth's late rebellion, but<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page513">[pg 513]</span><a name="Pg513" id="Pg513" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he had succeeded in obtaining a pardon by promises
of valuable information against others. With the
king's pardon in his pocket he unblushingly declared
before the judges that he, as well as Cornish and
some others, had determined upon a general rising in
the city at the time of the Rye House Plot. "We
designed," said he, "to divide it (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the city) into
twenty parts, and out of each part to raise five
hundred men, if it might be done, to make an insurrection."<a id="noteref_1570" name="noteref_1570" href="#note_1570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1570</span></span></a>
The Tower was to be seized and the
guard expelled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornish had been afforded no opportunity for
instructing counsel in his defence. He was therefore
obliged to act as his own counsel, with the result
usual in such cases. He rested his main defence upon
the improbability of his having acted as the prosecution
endeavoured to make out. This he so persistently
urged that the judges lost patience. Improbability was
not enough, they declared; let him call his witnesses.
When, however, Cornish desired an adjournment in
order that he might bring a witness up from Lancashire,
his request was refused. His chief witness he omitted
to call until after the lord chief justice had summed up.
This man was a vintner of the city, named Shephard, at
whose house Cornish was charged with having met and
held consultation with Monmouth and the rest of the
conspirators. The bench after some demur assented
to the prisoner's earnest prayer that Shephard's evidence
might be taken. He showed that he had been
in the habit of having commercial transactions with
Cornish and was at that moment in his debt; that on
the occasion in question Cornish had come to his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page514">[pg 514]</span><a name="Pg514" id="Pg514" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
house, but whether he came to speak with the Duke
of Monmouth or not the witness could not say for
certain; that he only remained a few minutes, and
that no paper or declaration (on which so much stress
had been laid) in connection with the conspiracy was
read in Cornish's presence; that in fact Cornish was
not considered at the time as being in the plot. Such
evidence, if not conclusive, ought to have gone far
towards obtaining a verdict of acquittal for the prisoner.
This was not the case, however; the witness was
characterised by one of the judges as "very forward,"
and when Cornish humbly remonstrated with the
treatment his witness was receiving from the bench he
was sharply told to hold his tongue. The jury after
a brief consultation brought in a verdict of guilty,
and Cornish had to submit to the indignity of being
tied—like a dangerous criminal—whilst sentence of
death was passed upon him and three others who
had been tried at the same time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prisoner was allowed but three clear days
before he was hanged at the corner of King Street

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the three others who had been tried with
Cornish, two were reprieved (one was afterwards
executed), but the third, Elizabeth Gaunt, was burnt
at Tyburn the same day that Cornish suffered (23 Oct.)
for having harboured an outlaw named Burton and
assisted him to escape beyond the law. He had been
implicated in the Rye House Plot, but with the aid
of Mrs. Gaunt, who lived in the city, had contrived to
avoid capture. In order to save his own skin the
wretch did not hesitate to turn king's evidence and
to sacrifice the life of his benefactress, a woman who
is described as having "spent a great part of her life
in acts of charity, visiting the gaols and looking
after the poor." She too died with great fortitude,
arranging with her own hands the straw around her,
so as to burn the more speedily.<a id="noteref_1573" name="noteref_1573" href="#note_1573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1573</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parliament began to be alarmed at the favour
shown to Catholics, and this alarm was increased by a
report from France that Louis XIV, with whom James
was known to be closely allied, and on whom he
depended, like his late brother, for pecuniary support,
had revoked the Edict of Nantes granted by Henry
IV in favour of his Protestant subjects. The report
was soon confirmed by the appearance of numbers of
French Protestants—refugees from persecution—in
England, and more especially in the city of London.
What Louis had done in France James, it was feared,
would carry out in England by means of his standing
army commanded by Roman Catholic officers. Hence
the alarm which pervaded not only parliament, but
also the city and the nation at large.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without a parliament James could act with a
free hand. By a piece of chicanery he managed to
get a legal decision acknowledging the dispensing
power of the king.<a id="noteref_1576" name="noteref_1576" href="#note_1576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1576</span></span></a> He established an Ecclesiastical
Commission Court, with the infamous Jeffreys at its
head, the first act of which was to suspend the Bishop
of London for upholding the Protestant faith. He
removed the Earl of Clarendon (son of the late Chancellor),
who had recently been appointed Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland,<a id="noteref_1577" name="noteref_1577" href="#note_1577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1577</span></span></a> and appointed as lord deputy the
Earl of Tyrconnel, a Roman Catholic of low character,
who had gained an unenviable notoriety as the "lying
Dick Talbot." The country was over-run with Papists
from abroad. All the laws against the exercise of the
Roman Catholic religion were set at defiance. There
was no disguise. Mass was publicly celebrated at
Whitehall and Roman Catholic chapels sprang up
everywhere, giving rise to no small dissatisfaction and
tumult. The agitation in London was great, but greater
in the city, where men had been less accustomed to the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page517">[pg 517]</span><a name="Pg517" id="Pg517" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sight of the Romish ceremonial than those who lived
in the neighbourhood of the court. Riots in the city
were of frequent occurrence, more especially on Sundays,
when the Roman Catholics were more in evidence
than on week days. A Roman Catholic chapel had
recently been erected by the Elector Palatine in Lime
Street. An ineffectual attempt had been made by the
mayor and aldermen to stay the work. They were
summoned to appear before the king and reprimanded.
The work was accordingly allowed to go on and the
chapel was opened. On Sunday, the 18th April (1686),
the priests attached to the chapel were followed by a
mob into Cheapside, and matters would have gone hard
with them had not the mayor and aldermen appeared
on the scene with a regiment of trained bands. James
again sent for the mayor and told him that if he could
not keep better order in the city he should himself send
some "assistance."<a id="noteref_1578" name="noteref_1578" href="#note_1578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1578</span></span></a> Nevertheless another riot broke
out on the following Sunday. A mob entered a Roman
Catholic chapel and carried away a crucifix, crying
out they would have no "wooden gods." A cross
was set up on the parish pump and mock obeisance
made to it. The priests were insulted, but no violence
was offered them. When the mayor appeared to
quell the tumult the crowd affected to disbelieve
that his lordship was in earnest. "What! the lord
mayor of our city come to preach up popery! too
sure, it cannot be!" When the trained bands were
ordered to disperse the crowd they declared that
in conscience they could not hinder them in their
work.<a id="noteref_1579" name="noteref_1579" href="#note_1579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1579</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These disturbances were very injurious to the
trade of the city, and caused a considerable fall in the
amount of customs paid for merchandise entering the
port of London. A regiment or two of the standing
army which James had formed might any day appear
in the city. "I shall not wonder if the Scotch regiment
of guards now quartering at Greenwich be
quartered in Cheapside before this week is out,"
wrote a contemporary on the 27th April.<a id="noteref_1580" name="noteref_1580" href="#note_1580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1580</span></span></a> A month

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a time James had entertained the hope of
obtaining favours for the Catholics with the goodwill
of the Church of England, whilst continuing the persecution
of dissenters. Finding this impossible he
determined to make friends of the dissenters, and to
include them in a general declaration of indulgence.
Accordingly on the 4th April, 1687, there appeared a
Declaration of Indulgence suspending all laws against
Roman Catholics and dissenters alike.<a id="noteref_1582" name="noteref_1582" href="#note_1582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1582</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James would willingly have obtained parliamentary
sanction for his declaration if he could. To
this end he again took to tampering with corporations
throughout the country, in the hope of securing thereby
a parliament favourable to his policy of toleration.
Six commissioners were appointed in November to
"regulate" all the corporations of England, by turning
out all who were opposed to the abolition of the penal
laws and Test Act and putting in their place those who<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page519">[pg 519]</span><a name="Pg519" id="Pg519" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
favoured it.<a id="noteref_1583" name="noteref_1583" href="#note_1583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1583</span></span></a> In London dispensations were granted to
the livery companies relieving their members from
taking the oaths and test, whilst similar dispensations
were included in the royal commissions appointing
aldermen. In many of the companies Tories of a
too pronounced character were turned out and their
places taken by dissenters.<a id="noteref_1584" name="noteref_1584" href="#note_1584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1584</span></span></a> Everywhere dissenters
were treated with the greatest consideration. Notwithstanding
every effort, however, to capture the constituencies
at the next elections, James found public
opinion against him to be too strong, and all thought
of summoning a fresh parliament had to be abandoned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile addresses flowed in from
various parts of the country thanking the king for his
declaration. Presbyterians, Quakers, Independents,
Congregationalists alike sent addresses, but as yet no
address was presented on behalf of the Court of
Aldermen—the governing body of the city, now
that the Common Council was in abeyance. That
body had to be largely remodelled before it would
consent to present any such address. On Thursday,
the 16th June, the infamous Jeffreys, who had been
rewarded with the seals for his work at the Bloody
Assizes, appeared before the Court of Aldermen and
declared his majesty's pleasure that in future that
court should nominate and recommend to the Crown
such persons as they thought fit to be aldermen as
vacancies occurred, and that no one so nominated<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a name="Pg520" id="Pg520" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should be exempt from service except for insufficiency
of estate, to be declared on oath. Those who were
capable of serving and refused to serve when
nominated by the court were to be fined, and the
fines were to be devoted to the use and benefit of the
city's orphans. The ancient privilege, too, of the
mayor drinking to a future sheriff received the king's
sanction.<a id="noteref_1585" name="noteref_1585" href="#note_1585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1585</span></span></a> Having listened to the lord chancellor's
message the court resolved to wait upon the king at
Windsor on the following Sunday to thank his
majesty "for that and all other his majesties acts of
grace to this court and city."<a id="noteref_1586" name="noteref_1586" href="#note_1586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1586</span></span></a> Both the mayor and the
Court of Aldermen lost no time in exercising their privileges,
but they experienced great difficulty in getting
any one to serve sheriff or alderman. Fines ran up
apace, until no less than £8,500 had been paid by persons
desirous at any cost to be discharged from filling
either of those thankless offices. Many of the aldermen
either voluntarily resigned their gowns or were
dismissed from the court because they were unwilling to
vote an address of thanks to James for his declaration.<a id="noteref_1587" name="noteref_1587" href="#note_1587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1587</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the court was sufficiently packed with
dissenters to pass an address to the king (26 July)
thanking him for his declaration, and assuring his

amount of money that the declaration had been the
means of bringing into the orphans' fund.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not every dissenter welcomed the king's
declaration. To many of them it seemed—what the
king intended it to be—only a lever for raising the
Roman Catholics. Baxter, to whom friendly overtures
were made by government to win him over,
refused to join in any address of thanks for the
declaration.  John Howe declared himself an
opponent of the dispensing power, and Bunyan
declined to enter into any negotiations on the matter
at all.  William Kiffin, on the other hand, an
influential Baptist in the city, succumbed to the
threats, if not to the blandishments, of James.<a id="noteref_1590" name="noteref_1590" href="#note_1590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1590</span></span></a> In
addition to possessing spiritual gifts of no mean
order, Kiffin was also a man of wealth and position
in the world of commerce. In every way he would
prove a valuable ally, if only he could be won over.
Against this, however, there was one great impediment:
the recollection of the judicial murder of
his two grandsons, Benjamin and William Hewling,
by Jeffreys at the Bloody Assizes. Fondly imagining
that the memory of that foul act could be blotted
out and the stricken heart salved by an increase
of wealth or elevation in rank, James sent for him
to court, and after some preliminary remarks touching
the royal favour that was being shown to dissenters,
told Kiffin that he had put him down as an alderman
in his "new charter," alluding no doubt to the royal
commission of 6th August, in which Kiffin's name
appears as alderman of Cheap ward in the place of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a name="Pg522" id="Pg522" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Samuel Dashwood. On hearing this Kiffin replied,
"Sir, I am a very old man,"—he was seventy years
of age when he lost his grandchildren—"I have withdrawn
myself from all kind of business for some
years past, and am incapable of doing any service
in such an affair to your majesty or the city.
Besides, sir," the old man continued, with tears
running down his cheeks, and looking the king
steadily in the face, "the death of my grandsons
gave a wound to my heart which is still bleeding,
and never will close but in the grave." For a
moment the king was abashed, but quickly recovering
himself told Kiffin that he (James) would find "a
balsam for that sore." The old man still held out,
until, hearing that legal proceedings were about to be
taken against him, he took counsel's opinion as to
what was best to be done. He was told that he was
running a great risk by refusing to become an
alderman, for the judges, as they then were, might
subject him to a penalty of ten, twenty, or thirty
thousand pounds, "even what they pleased." Under
such circumstances he consented to be made an
alderman, rather than bring ruin on himself and family.
He, however, put off the evil day as long as he could,
and was not sworn into office until the 27th October.<a id="noteref_1591" name="noteref_1591" href="#note_1591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1591</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Kiffin expressed himself as pleased with the
reception he met with in his ward, where he was
almost a stranger. But much of the business which
the Court of Aldermen was called upon to execute
in those days was distasteful to him. "We had
frequently orders from the king" (he writes) "to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page523">[pg 523]</span><a name="Pg523" id="Pg523" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
send to the several companies to put out great
numbers of liverymen out of the privilege of being
liverymen, and others to be put in their rooms;
most of which that were so turned out were
Protestants of the Church of England. There has
been a list of seven hundred at a time to be discharged,
although no crime laid to their charge."
The royal commission which appointed him an
alderman also created him a justice of the peace and
a member of the Court of Lieutenancy, but to use his
own words, "I never meddled with either of those
places, neither in any act of power in that court
[<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Court of Aldermen] touching causes between
man and man, but only such things as concerned
the welfare of the city and good of the orphans,
whose distressed condition called for help, although
we were able to do little towards it." He was not
called upon to discharge his invidious duties for any
great length of time; for after being in office only
nine months he obtained his discharge, to his "very
great satisfaction." He continued to live for another
thirteen years, dying on the 29th December, 1701, in
his 86th year, and he was buried in Bunhill Fields—that
"God's acre" which holds the dust of so many
of his fellow non-conformists.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In September the king had issued a patent for

was married to Sir Robert Walpole. He
was at one time alderman of Cripplegate ward, but
in December, 1682, he fell foul of Charles II for
attending a conventicle at Pinmakers' Hall, and the
Court of Aldermen received orders to remove him.<a id="noteref_1594" name="noteref_1594" href="#note_1594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1594</span></span></a>
He had recently, however (6 Aug., 1687), been
restored to his aldermanry and to his rank of precedence
by commission from James,<a id="noteref_1595" name="noteref_1595" href="#note_1595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1595</span></span></a> and now, by the same
usurped authority, he was to become lord mayor.
The feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.) happening
this year to fall on a Friday, the installation
of the new lord mayor, as well as the banquet to
which James and the Papal Nuncio had been invited,
was postponed until the following day. The aldermen
agreed to defray the cost of the entertainment
out of their own pockets,<a id="noteref_1596" name="noteref_1596" href="#note_1596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1596</span></span></a> each laying down the sum
of £50. Kiffin also sent £50, although he had not yet
been sworn a member of the court; but he afterwards
regretted having done so when he learnt that
the Pope's Nuncio and other priests had been invited
as guests.<a id="noteref_1597" name="noteref_1597" href="#note_1597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1597</span></span></a> The day passed off well. The Goldsmiths'
Company, of which the new lord mayor

himself as well pleased with the entertainment

way. The livery companies had become so leavened
with an influx of new members, whose claim for
admittance rested chiefly on their antagonism to the
established Church, that most of them now sent in
addresses to the king thanking him for his Declaration
of Indulgence. The Barber-Surgeons and the Apothecaries
had already done so; so had the Clothworkers,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Spring of 1688 James published a second
Declaration of Indulgence varying but slightly from
the former one, and ordered it to be read in the
churches of London and Westminster on the 20th and
27th May, and in the country on the 3rd and 10th
June. This was more than the clergy could stand.
A meeting of bishops was held at Lambeth for the
purpose of drawing up a petition to the king praying<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page526">[pg 526]</span><a name="Pg526" id="Pg526" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the clergy might be excused reading an illegal
document in the midst of public service. This petition
was signed by Sancroft, the primate, and six bishops.
Although the Bishop of London was not among
those who signed the petition—he at the time being
under disability—there is reason for believing that
Compton had been taken into counsel by those who
drafted it.<a id="noteref_1603" name="noteref_1603" href="#note_1603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1603</span></span></a> On the petition being presented James
pretended the utmost surprise, and insisted that the
presentation of such a petition was "a standard of
rebellion." This took place on Friday preceding the
first Sunday (20th May) when the Declaration was
to be read in the London churches. When Sunday
arrived people flocked to the churches to hear what
would happen. Only a few of the London clergy
attempted to read the Declaration.<a id="noteref_1604" name="noteref_1604" href="#note_1604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1604</span></span></a> In the country
not more than 200 clergy carried out the king's orders,
"and of these some read it the first Sunday, but
changed their minds before the second; others
declared in their sermons that though they obeyed
the order they did not approve the Declaration."
One minister in particular told his congregation that
though he was obliged to read it they were not obliged
to hear it, and waited until all had left the church
before he commenced reading the hateful document.
In other places the congregation took the initiative
and rose to go as soon as the minister commenced
reading it.<a id="noteref_1605" name="noteref_1605" href="#note_1605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1605</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What followed is well known. On Friday the
8th June the Archbishop of Canterbury and the six
bishops who had signed the petition were summoned<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page527">[pg 527]</span><a name="Pg527" id="Pg527" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before the council and asked if they acknowledged
their respective signatures. They were next required
to enter into bond for appearance before the King's
Bench. This they declined to do, and were thereupon
committed to the Tower.<a id="noteref_1606" name="noteref_1606" href="#note_1606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1606</span></span></a> To have carried them
through the streets of the city might have caused a
riot; they were therefore conveyed to the Tower by
water, "and all along as they passed the banks of the
river were full of people, who kneeled down and
asked their blessing, and with loud shouts expressed
their good wishes for them and their concern in their
preservation."<a id="noteref_1607" name="noteref_1607" href="#note_1607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1607</span></span></a> The enthusiasm of the Londoners
did not end here. They continued to flock to the
Tower, filling the small chapel where the bishops
attended service to overflowing in order to gaze upon
their beloved pastors and receive their blessing.<a id="noteref_1608" name="noteref_1608" href="#note_1608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1608</span></span></a> After
being kept in separate confinement, and allowed to
meet only at meals and in chapel, for ten days, the
bishops were allowed to come out on bail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 29th June they appeared before the
King's Bench on a charge of publishing a seditious
libel. A technical difficulty presented itself at the
outset, but this was got over, and after a trial of some
hours the question of their innocence or guilt was left
to a jury drawn, not from London, but from the
county of Middlesex. One of the panel stuck out
against the rest, and wished to bring in a verdict of
guilty, but after being locked up through the night he
allowed himself to be persuaded by his fellow-jurymen,
and on the morning of the 30th June a verdict of
not guilty was found. Thereupon "there were such
shoutings, so long continued, and as it were echoed<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page528">[pg 528]</span><a name="Pg528" id="Pg528" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Bonfires were lighted, guns discharged and church bells
rung, not only in London but throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beginning of the end was approaching.
Already the troops encamped at Hounslow, on which
James placed so much dependence, showed signs of
disaffection. He had hoped that his army would
have overawed London, instead of which the free
spirit of London had, as a result of his policy, entirely
captivated his army. So long as the king was in their
midst the troops maintained a respectful demeanour,
but as soon as his back was turned they threw off all
restraint, and joined in the general exultation at the
late joyful deliverance to the Church of England.<a id="noteref_1610" name="noteref_1610" href="#note_1610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1610</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The birth of a prince (10 June), which had
recently taken place, served to hasten the crisis.
Those who were willing to have waited patiently for
a recurrence to the old order of things at the king's
death now saw their hopes dashed to the ground.
The king's heir and successor, brought up, as he
undoubtedly would be, in the tenets of his father,
promised them little relief. Even before the birth of
the prince overtures had been made to William of
Orange to appear in England at the head of an army.
Nevertheless the Court of Aldermen displayed its
loyalty by resolving that the conduits in Cheapside
and at the Stocks Market should run with claret on
Thanksgiving-day. The sheriffs were to take the
matter in hand, whilst the sum of £50 was raised by
the court to defray the cost, the mayor contributing
£10, each of the sheriffs £5, and the rest of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page529">[pg 529]</span><a name="Pg529" id="Pg529" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

(29 June) the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs waited
upon the infant prince and kissed his hand. The
various nurses were presented by the Chamberlain
with the respectable <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">douceur</span></span> of sixty guineas, whilst
ten guineas were given to the lord chancellor's
messenger who brought the news to the city of the
prince's birth.<a id="noteref_1612" name="noteref_1612" href="#note_1612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1612</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day that saw the bishops acquitted a letter was
despatched, signed by Shrewsbury, Danby, Compton
(the suspended Bishop of London) and others, to the
Prince of Orange, again inviting him to land in England
with an armed force, and promising to render him
every assistance. After some hesitation William accepted
the invitation, and began to make preparations,
both naval and military, for his descent on England.
Towards the close of September news came from
Holland of the vast preparations that were being
pushed forward in that country. A fleet of sixty sail
was in readiness, and the prince himself was shortly
expected on board. James lost no time in informing
the lord mayor of the state of affairs, and desired that
he and the aldermen would take measures for preserving
the city in peace.<a id="noteref_1613" name="noteref_1613" href="#note_1613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1613</span></span></a> On the 28th he issued a

jealousies and to unite in defending the country
against the foreign enemy.<a id="noteref_1614" name="noteref_1614" href="#note_1614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1614</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James saw, when it was too late, that he had
over-taxed the patience of his subjects. He was now<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page530">[pg 530]</span><a name="Pg530" id="Pg530" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ready to make any and every concession. As for the
citizens of London, they should have their charter
restored. Accordingly, on Saturday the 6th October
Lord Chancellor Jeffreys appeared before the Court
of Aldermen with two separate grants under the
great seal, the one appointing Sir John Chapman to
be mayor (in the place of Sir John Eyles<a id="noteref_1615" name="noteref_1615" href="#note_1615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1615</span></span></a>) up to the
feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.), with liberty
to the citizens in the meantime to elect one of their
own choice to be mayor for the year ensuing; the
other, continuing in office Sir Samuel Thompson and
Sir Humphrey Edwin, then sheriffs, until a new
election of sheriffs should be made by the citizens.
The newly-appointed mayor and the existing sheriffs
thereupon went down into the Guildhall, accompanied
by the lord chancellor, who informed the
citizens of the restitution of their liberties.<a id="noteref_1616" name="noteref_1616" href="#note_1616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1616</span></span></a> The
mayor and sheriffs having taken the oaths and subscribed
the declaration prescribed by the Corporation
Act, the aldermen returned to their chamber, and
such as had been aldermen at the time of the
judgment upon the writ of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</span></span> and
were then present were forthwith sworn in for the
respective wards from which they had been deposed.
The court next proceeded to draw up an address to
the king, in which his majesty was assured that with
all duty and faithfulness they would cheerfully and
readily <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discharge the trust reposed in them</span></em> to the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page531">[pg 531]</span><a name="Pg531" id="Pg531" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

cannot help noticing how studiously different the
wording of this address is from those previously
presented. Not a word about defending his majesty's
person with their lives and fortunes; these are thenceforth
to be expended in guarding their own liberties!
When the Court of Aldermen met three days later
(9 Oct.) the common sergeant, the town clerk, the
comptroller, swordbearer, common crier and other
officers who had been ousted from their places under
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</span></span> were formally re-instated;<a id="noteref_1618" name="noteref_1618" href="#note_1618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1618</span></span></a> and the
same day Chapman issued his precept for a Common
Hall to meet on the 11th for the election of sheriffs
for the year ensuing.<a id="noteref_1619" name="noteref_1619" href="#note_1619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1619</span></span></a> Several aldermen who had

Treby, who had been recorder at the time of the
confiscation of the city's liberties, also refused to
accept office again; but the Court of Aldermen
finding great difficulty in getting a suitable person to
accept the appointment, Treby was finally induced
to change his mind, and before the end of the year
he occupied his old place and continued to occupy it
until, in 1692, he was made chief justice of common
pleas.<a id="noteref_1621" name="noteref_1621" href="#note_1621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1621</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city was still without a Common Council,
and it was not until the 26th November that the
Court of Aldermen advised the mayor to issue his
precept for an election of common councilmen to

to be but a provisional one until the regular election
should take place on St. Thomas-day (21 Dec.).<a id="noteref_1622" name="noteref_1622" href="#note_1622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1622</span></span></a> On

off) notified that writs were about to be issued
for a new parliament. The House was to meet on
the 15th January (1689). James had purposed summoning
a parliament for November (1688), and some
of the writs had been actually sent out, but the
Dutch preparations so alarmed him that the writs
were recalled.<a id="noteref_1624" name="noteref_1624" href="#note_1624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1624</span></span></a></p>

been held at Whitehall (20 Oct.) which the mayor
and aldermen of the city had been invited to attend.
The object of the meeting was to dissipate any doubt
that had been entertained as to the infant prince
being actually the king's son. There had been
rumours to the contrary, and as the king was about
to enter upon a dangerous enterprise in person, he
declared his intention of settling the question beyond
all doubt before leaving. Some twenty witnesses
were accordingly examined then and there as to the
prince's legitimacy, the king offering to send for the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page533">[pg 533]</span><a name="Pg533" id="Pg533" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

on Sunday, Sir John Chapman, who had been re-elected
mayor by free choice of the citizens, proceeded
to Westminster by water according to custom on the

was sworn before the barons of the exchequer. He
returned to Grocers' Hall and there entertained the
lords of the council, the judges and many of the
nobility. Notwithstanding the precautions taken
against riot during the mayor's absence from the city
the mob broke out and sacked and burnt a "mass

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 5th November the Prince of Orange successfully
effected a landing in Torbay. As soon as
the news reached London James again sent for the
mayor and aldermen, ordered them to take care of the
city, and, if he should fall in battle, to proclaim the
Prince of Wales successor to the crown.<a id="noteref_1628" name="noteref_1628" href="#note_1628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1628</span></span></a> William
proceeded to march upon London. At Exeter he was
well received, but some little time elapsed before the
gentry showed any disposition to throw in their lot
with the prince. On the 17th James set out with his
army to meet the invader, after receiving an assurance
from the mayor and aldermen that they would take<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page534">[pg 534]</span><a name="Pg534" id="Pg534" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Salisbury, but soon found himself deserted by officers
and friends. Among the former was Lord Churchill,
afterwards known as the Duke of Marlborough, and the
greatest soldier of the age. Left almost alone, James
returned to London, having been absent from the
capital less than ten days. Like his name-sake the
Conqueror, William made no haste to reach London,
but advanced by slow marches, putting up at various
gentlemen's houses on the way. It was agreed that
both armies should remain at a distance of forty
miles from London in order to allow the new
parliament to meet in safety.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the news of the prince's landing there had
been a renewal of the attacks made on Roman
Catholics and their places of worship in London. On
the 11th November the mob broke into St. John's,
Clerkenwell, where rumour declared there were stored
gridirons, spits and other instruments for torturing
Protestants. The troops were called out and one or
two of the rioters killed. It was deemed advisable to
close all the Roman Catholic chapels except the royal
chapels and those belonging to foreign ambassadors.<a id="noteref_1630" name="noteref_1630" href="#note_1630"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1630</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The negotiations which had been opened with
William were only intended by James to serve the
purpose of giving the latter time to place his wife and
child in a place of security before he himself should
seek safety in flight. On the 11th December he
attempted to make good his escape. As soon as it
was known that the king had left London a great
number of lords, both spiritual and temporal, came to
the Guildhall, as to a place of security, the better to
consult and take measures for the common weal.
Having informed the Court of Aldermen of the king's
flight the lords retired into the "gallery adjoining to
y<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">e</span></span> councell chamber," and there drew up a Declaration,<a id="noteref_1633" name="noteref_1633" href="#note_1633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1633</span></span></a>
containing in effect their resolution to assist
the Prince of Orange in maintaining the religion, the
rights and the liberties which had been invaded by
Jesuitical counsels. This was communicated to the
Court of Aldermen, who thanked the lords for the
favour shown to the Court. As the occasion was an
important one it was deemed advisable to summon
forthwith a Common Council, as well as the law
officers of the City, to advise the aldermen as to what
was best to be done.<a id="noteref_1634" name="noteref_1634" href="#note_1634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1634</span></span></a> A Common Council was
accordingly held that same day. Being informed of
the state of affairs, the court quickly resolved to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page536">[pg 536]</span><a name="Pg536" id="Pg536" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
follow the example set by the lords, and themselves
to present an address to the prince.<a id="noteref_1635" name="noteref_1635" href="#note_1635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1635</span></span></a> An address
was accordingly prepared, in which, having warmly
acknowledged the prince's zeal for the Protestant
religion and expressed regret at the king's measures
and his recent flight, the citizens implored the prince's
protection, promising him at the same time a hearty
welcome whenever he should repair to their city.
The lieutenancy of the city followed suit the same
day with another address, in which his highness was
assured that measures had been taken for preserving
the city in peace until his arrival.<a id="noteref_1636" name="noteref_1636" href="#note_1636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1636</span></span></a> The lords, having

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 17th a letter from the prince was read
before the Common Council. The terms of the letter
are not recorded in the City's archives, but it probably
contained some reference to the peace of the city, for
the council, after preparing an answer to it, forthwith
gave orders for the guards of the trained bands to be
increased by three regiments.<a id="noteref_1638" name="noteref_1638" href="#note_1638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1638</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following day (18 Dec.) the prince himself
entered London, and the council, having heard of his
arrival, immediately despatched the sheriffs and the
common sergeant to learn when his highness would
be pleased to receive a deputation from the city. It
was arranged that the aldermen and their deputies
and one or two members of the council of each ward,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page537">[pg 537]</span><a name="Pg537" id="Pg537" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to the number of its representatives, should

being indisposed was unable to attend. He had
recently been seized with a fit of apoplexy whilst
trying the terrible Jeffreys, who had been discovered
and apprehended in disguise at Wapping. But Treby,
the recorder, was there, and made a speech on the
City's behalf.<a id="noteref_1640" name="noteref_1640" href="#note_1640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1640</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time James, who had been foiled in his
first attempt to reach the coast, and had returned to
London, had, with the connivance of the Prince of
Orange, been more successful in a second attempt, and
had crossed over to France, where he spent the
remainder of his days. The country was therefore left
without king, parliament or legal system for its
government. In London the Corporation of the city
was almost the only authority that remained unaffected
by the king's abdication; and it is significant as well
of its power as of the respect which that body commanded
that when William was endeavouring to form
an authoritative assembly by summoning all the members
who had ever sat in parliament under Charles II,<a id="noteref_1641" name="noteref_1641" href="#note_1641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1641</span></span></a>
he likewise desired that the lord mayor of the city,
the entire Court of Aldermen and fifty representatives
of the Common Council should attend.<a id="noteref_1642" name="noteref_1642" href="#note_1642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1642</span></span></a> This assembly
met on the 26th December, and after due consultation
decided to adopt the same procedure as was adopted
in 1660 before the return of Charles II. As there<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page538">[pg 538]</span><a name="Pg538" id="Pg538" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was no king there could be no writs for a parliament,
but William could call a Convention, which would be
a parliament in everything but name. A Convention
was accordingly summoned to meet on the 22nd
January, 1689. The election of the city members to
serve in the convention was ordered to take place on
Wednesday the 9th January,<a id="noteref_1643" name="noteref_1643" href="#note_1643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1643</span></span></a> when the choice of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime (8 Jan.) the prince wrote to
the civic authorities setting forth the inadequacy of
the revenue to supply three pressing wants. These
were the maintenance of the navy, the partial disbandment
of the army and the furnishing of a force
for the speedy relief of the Protestants in Ireland.
He desired the City, therefore, to advance him such a
sum as could be "conveniently spared."<a id="noteref_1645" name="noteref_1645" href="#note_1645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1645</span></span></a> The City
was still to keep up its character as the purse of the
nation. The Common Council, having heard the
letter read, at once resolved to assist the prince to
the utmost of their power. A committee was appointed
to settle with the revenue officers the nature
of the security, and orders were given for precepts
to be sent to the aldermen to raise subscriptions
in the various wards.<a id="noteref_1646" name="noteref_1646" href="#note_1646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1646</span></span></a> Sir Peter Rich, who had recently

which he had been ousted, was instructed to pay into
the exchequer all money received on account of the
loan, and to strike tallies for the same in his own
name in trust for the use of the several lenders. Ten
days later (18 Jan.) the committee reported the steps
taken for the security of repayment of the money
already paid into the exchequer, and the council
recommended that similar steps should be taken with
respect to those sums yet to be paid in. It was at
the same time unanimously agreed to ask the Prince
to dinner in the city, and the recorder, the sheriffs
and the common sergeant were instructed to wait on
his highness and learn his pleasure.<a id="noteref_1647" name="noteref_1647" href="#note_1647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1647</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 22nd January the Convention met. On
the 28th the Commons declared the throne to be
vacant, and on the 6th February a vote to similar
effect was passed by the Lords. Some over-zealous
inhabitants of the city had in the meanwhile prepared a
petition, which they purposed presenting to the House
of Lords, praying that the crown might be offered to
the Prince of Orange and his consort. The prince
ordered the lord mayor to put a stop to such proceedings,
and a precept (200 copies of which were ordered
to be printed) was accordingly issued to this effect.<a id="noteref_1648" name="noteref_1648" href="#note_1648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1648</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the coronation banquet of the king and queen,
which took place on the 11th April, the masters of
the twelve principal livery companies were for the

and they continued to be so nominated on like occasions
up to the coronation of George IV, when in consequence
of a change of masters taking place between the time
of their nomination and the day of the coronation, the
new masters presented a petition to the Court of Claims
praying to have their names inserted in the place of
the former masters whose term of office had expired.
This petition was opposed by the Remembrancer, on
behalf of the City, on the ground that the masters
of the livery companies enjoyed no peculiar right
to serve on such occasions, and after some deliberation
the commissioners declined to interfere, inasmuch
as the power of nominating the twelve citizens rested
absolutely with the Court of Aldermen.<a id="noteref_1652" name="noteref_1652" href="#note_1652"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1652</span></span></a> The lord

later (5 March) the Grand Committee of Grievances
reported to the House its opinion (1) that the rights

was illegal and a grievance, and (2) that the judgment
given upon the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</span></span> against the city was

other matters which led up to the proceedings under
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</span></span>, when, as the committee had discovered,
two of the justices of the King's Bench—Pemberton
and Dolben—were removed from the court
because their opinion was found to be in favour of the
city. The committee refer to the City's Records in
support of the claim of the lord mayor to elect one of
the sheriffs, and say "that from the twenty-first of
Edward the III<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">d</span></span> unto the year 1641 the way of
making sheriffs was that the lord mayor named one
to be sheriff and presented him to the Common
Hall, who did confirm him, and chose another to act
with him; except in three or four years within that
time, when the Common Hall chose both the sheriffs,
the persons drank to in those years by the lord
mayor having refused to hold and paid their fines."
They capitulated to the House the various occasions
on which the mayor exercised his prerogative unchallenged,
and those when the Common Hall refused
to confirm the mayor's nomination, down to 1682,
when matters were brought to a crisis by Sir John
Moore claiming to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elected</span></em> Dudley North by

London in the election of sheriffs for the said city in
the year 1682."</p>

had not been idle. The Common Council had already

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was another matter pressing very heavily
upon the City just now, and one which later on would
also claim the attention of parliament, and that
was the relationship of the civic authorities to the
city orphans. By the custom of London the mayor
and aldermen were the recognised guardians of all
citizens' orphans, and as such took charge of their
property until they came of age or married. A
Court of Orphans was established, with the common
sergeant as its chief officer, which exercised the same
jurisdiction over the bodies and goods of orphans in
the city that the Court of Chancery exercised outside.
In course of time the fund paid into this court became
very considerable, and in order to prevent it lying
idle and thus deprive the orphans of interest that
might accrue on their estate, the court lent large sums
to the Crown on the security of exchequer bills.
Could any guardian or trustee have acted more<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page544">[pg 544]</span><a name="Pg544" id="Pg544" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
honestly or with greater prudence? They had not
reckoned, however, upon a king being on the throne
who should be sufficiently dishonest to stop all payments
out of the exchequer in discharge of principal
and interest of past loans. This is what Charles II
did, as we have seen, in 1672; and his action not only
ruined many bankers and merchants of the city, but
inflicted great hardship upon the city's fatherless
children. The City's revenue at the time of William's
accession was little more than sufficient to meet the
necessary expenses of the municipality, to say
nothing of repaying the orphans their confiscated
estates. This fact was recognised by the orphans
themselves, who saw no other hope but to apply to
parliament for assistance with the aid of the Common
Council.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this end "a large number" of orphans of the
city presented a petition to the court on the 1st March.<a id="noteref_1659" name="noteref_1659" href="#note_1659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1659</span></span></a>
Their fortunes (they said) had been paid into the
Chamber of London according to the custom of
the city, and they were now left destitute of
support and reduced to great hardships and extremities,
very many of them having their whole
portions in the Chamber. They prayed the court,
therefore, to appoint a committee to consider the
whole matter with the view of approaching parliament
with some recommendation. To this the court
readily gave its consent, and a committee was then
and there nominated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week later (8 March) this committee made
a report to the council.<a id="noteref_1660" name="noteref_1660" href="#note_1660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1660</span></span></a> They had found upon<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page545">[pg 545]</span><a name="Pg545" id="Pg545" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
investigation that the debt owing by the Chamber
was very great, being upwards of £500,000 due on
principal money to orphans and nearly £100,000
more due to others, besides "finding money" and
interest. The committee were of opinion that before
any application was made to parliament the City
should first do what it could on its own account for
the relief of the orphans. The City's lands of
inheritance were estimated as bringing in about
£4,000 a year, subject to a charge of £500 or £600
for charitable uses, and the committee recommended
that lands to the value of £3,000 a year rental

£70,000 or thereabouts would be raised, and the
sum being devoted to the relief of the orphans would
be "a good introduction to request a further assistance
from the parliament." The charges of municipal
government must be met with the residue of the
"casual profits" of the Chamber. If parliament (the
report went on to say) would be pleased to assist by
granting a duty on coals and allowing the City to
tax hackney coachmen at 5<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> a head, the whole
debt, or at least the principal, might be liquidated.
A Bill which the committee had prepared for presentation
to parliament for this purpose was then
read and referred to the town clerk and the city
solicitor, as well as to the attorney and the solicitor-general
for their opinions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's intimation to the House (1 March)
that he was prepared, with its assent, to abolish the
odious Hearth Tax was received with universal joy.
The Commons immediately voted an address of

Common Council of the city resolved to present a
humble address of thanks to his majesty for the
welcome relief from a tax that had been from its

represented to the deputation by the mouth of the

constancy displayed by the City in the late revolution,
and more especially its action in advancing so large a
sum of money to his majesty at so critical a time.
The City's care for the public would never fail to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Sunday the 17th March a special Court of
Aldermen sat. The lord mayor, Sir John Chapman,
had died at ten o'clock that morning, and it became
necessary to take steps for the election of a mayor to
serve for the remainder of the mayoralty year, and to
secure, in the meantime, the peace of the city. Three
aldermen were despatched, accompanied by the town
clerk, to inform the king of the state of affairs, and
to assure him that care would be taken to prevent
disorder until a new mayor should be elected. To
secure this latter object a precept was at once issued
by the court for a double watch to be kept until
further orders, whilst another precept was issued for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page547">[pg 547]</span><a name="Pg547" id="Pg547" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a Common Hall to meet on the following Wednesday
(20 March) for the election of a new mayor.<a id="noteref_1664" name="noteref_1664" href="#note_1664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1664</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Common Hall met the choice of the
citizens fell upon their old friend and champion,
Pilkington, and Thomas Stampe; but a poll was
demanded by the supporters of two other candidates,
viz., Sir John Moore—who had already served
(1681-2) and in whose mayoralty there had been such
a fight over the election of sheriffs—and Jonathan
Raymond. It is said that the Tory party in the city
put up Moore for re-election by way of showing their
disgust at a recent resolution passed by the House of
Commons to the effect that Moore had been a betrayer
of the liberties of the City during his mayoralty.<a id="noteref_1665" name="noteref_1665" href="#note_1665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1665</span></span></a> But
however that may be (and no record of such a resolution
appears in the Journal of the House), the result
of the poll placed Stampe and Pilkington—with 1975
and 1973 votes respectively—far ahead of either of the
other candidates. Moore, indeed, was at the bottom
of the poll with only 780 votes, whilst Raymond only
polled 930. Stampe and Pilkington having been
returned to the Court of Aldermen for them to select
one, according to the custom, they chose Pilkington,
and he was accordingly admitted and sworn mayor
for the remainder of the year, being presented to the
Governor of the Tower by order of the king instead
of before the barons of the exchequer.<a id="noteref_1666" name="noteref_1666" href="#note_1666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1666</span></span></a> A few weeks

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Midsummer (1689) a difficulty again arose
with the election of sheriffs for the ensuing year. The<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page548">[pg 548]</span><a name="Pg548" id="Pg548" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

preferring to pay a fine to serving, the Common Hall
refused to elect others in their place. The Court of
Aldermen, finding themselves in a fix, sent for the
attorney-general to peruse the City's Records and to
give his advice in the matter. Lethieullier had determined
to cut all connection with the Corporation, and
had paid another fine to be relieved of the aldermanry
of the ward of Coleman Street. Nevertheless, by the
10th September both he and Houblon had been
persuaded to change their minds, and professed
themselves ready, if the Court of Aldermen so willed,
to take upon themselves the office of sheriffs.<a id="noteref_1669" name="noteref_1669" href="#note_1669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1669</span></span></a></p>

Those who had suffered during the last two reigns for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">William had achieved the crown of England
without bloodshed. In Ireland, as well as in Scotland,
he had to fight for his crown. The news that James
had landed in Ireland (12 March) created no small
excitement in the city. Volunteers were called for,
and were readily found. The trained bands were
augmented and new officers appointed.<a id="noteref_1675" name="noteref_1675" href="#note_1675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1675</span></span></a> When it was
found that James was marching to the north of Ireland,
where the citizens of London held a large interest, the
excitement was increased. On the 18th April he
appeared before the walls of Londonderry, expecting
the city to immediately surrender. Thanks to the
strength of those walls, repaired and fortified by the
care and at the charges of the citizens of London,<a id="noteref_1676" name="noteref_1676" href="#note_1676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1676</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page550">[pg 550]</span><a name="Pg550" id="Pg550" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and still more to the stout hearts behind them,
the town was able to stand a long and dreary
siege, with all its attendant horrors of slaughter
and starvation, and at last, after heroic resistance and
patient suffering for 105 days, to come off victorious.
There is one name more especially honoured in connection
with the famous siege, that of George Walker,
who, although a clergyman and advanced in years,
inspired the besieged with so much energy and
courage that from first to last there was no thought
of surrender. Attempts were made to win over the
garrison by intrigue, and among the devices set on
foot for establishing communication between besiegers
and the besieged was that of placing a letter in
an empty shell and firing the latter into the town.<a id="noteref_1677" name="noteref_1677" href="#note_1677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1677</span></span></a>
When Walker made his appearance in England he
was graciously received by the king, who made him
a present of £5,000 and promised to have a care for
the rest of the garrison.<a id="noteref_1678" name="noteref_1678" href="#note_1678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1678</span></span></a> The king afterwards desired

the Common Council at his majesty's request certain
letters which had been seized on board a ship at
Liverpool and forwarded by special messenger to the

custom, is not clear. The lord mayor's show was
(we are told) "very splendid," and was witnessed by
the king and queen and the Prince of Denmark from
a balcony in Cheapside. After the show they were
entertained, together with the members of both
Houses and high officers of state, at a banquet in the

those corporations that had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">surrendered</span></em> their charters,
and a great struggle took place upon the committee's
report (2 Jan., 1690) over an attempt to introduce a
clause providing that every municipal officer who had
in any way been a party to the surrender of a borough's
franchises should be incapable of holding any office
in that borough for a period of seven years.<a id="noteref_1687" name="noteref_1687" href="#note_1687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1687</span></span></a> The

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 6th February, 1690, the Convention
Parliament was dissolved. Its greatest achievement
had been the passing of the Bill of Rights, the third
Great Charter (as it has been called) of English
liberties. The Bill of Rights embodied the provisions
of the Declaration of Rights, and strictly regulated
the succession to the crown. It constituted the title-deed
by which the king was thenceforth to hold his
throne, and the people to enjoy their liberties. The
late parliament had been none too liberal to William
in the matter of supply. Money was much needed
for carrying on war with France and for reducing
Ireland. Extraordinary aids were voted from time
to time, but the money came in so slowly that the
king was fain to seek advances from the City.<a id="noteref_1689" name="noteref_1689" href="#note_1689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1689</span></span></a> A

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The election of members to serve the City in
the coming parliament took place on the 19th
February, and was hotly contested. There appears
to be no record extant among the City's archives of
what took place, but from a petition laid before the
new House (2 April) by Pilkington (the lord mayor)
and three others, viz., Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Patience
Ward and Sir William Ashurst<a id="noteref_1691" name="noteref_1691" href="#note_1691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1691</span></span></a>—all professing
more or less Whig principles—we learn that they
claimed to have been elected by the Common Hall.
A poll had been granted, and a scrutiny was in course
of being held when (as they complained) the sheriffs
declared the election to have gone against them.
The petitioners had afterwards learnt that upon the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page554">[pg 554]</span><a name="Pg554" id="Pg554" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
completion of the scrutiny the majority of those that
had a right to vote had proved to be in their favour.
They prayed therefore for relief. Their petition
was referred to the Committee of Privileges and
Elections for them to consider and report thereon
to the House; but nothing came of it. It was in
vain that Pilkington issued precepts to the livery
companies for returns to be made: (1) of the names
of those who were on the livery at Midsummer,
1683; (2) of those who had been admitted since;
(3) of those that had died since 1683, or who were
absent; and (4) of those who had omitted to take
the prescribed oaths for a freeman or liveryman—in
order to affect the scrutiny.<a id="noteref_1692" name="noteref_1692" href="#note_1692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1692</span></span></a> The result was declared
to be in favour of two aldermen and two commoners
of distinct Tory proclivities. These were Sir William
Pritchard, Sir Samuel Dashwood, Sir William Turner
(once an alderman and soon to become one again)
and Sir Thomas Vernon. Upon Turner's death in
February, 1693, Sir John Fleet, then lord mayor, was
elected in his place.<a id="noteref_1693" name="noteref_1693" href="#note_1693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1693</span></span></a> In the country the elections

passed an election of mayor, sheriffs and city chamberlain
took place on the 26th May, and an election of a
Common Council on the 10th June following. Such
as were then elected were according to the statute
to hold office not only for the remainder of the usual
term, but to continue in office throughout the year
ensuing. On the 26th May Pilkington was again
elected mayor, although the majority of votes in
Common Hall was in favour of Sir Jonathan Raymond,<a id="noteref_1700" name="noteref_1700" href="#note_1700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1700</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the elections for a new Common Council

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The state of affairs was at length brought to the
notice of parliament by a petition subscribed by
members of the Common Council and presented to
the House of Commons on the 3rd December.<a id="noteref_1705" name="noteref_1705" href="#note_1705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1705</span></span></a> The
petitioners explained to the House that they had
conceived and hoped that the late Act would have
restored the city to its ancient rights and privileges.
It had, however, done quite the contrary. They
then proceeded to relate how, notwithstanding the
Act, several aldermen of the city who had been
appointed by commissions under the late king continued
to act as such by virtue of certain doubtful
expressions in the Act; that by their illegally assumed
authority Pilkington had been declared and made
mayor, although not duly returned by the Common
Hall; that by the contrivance of the said mayor and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page557">[pg 557]</span><a name="Pg557" id="Pg557" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the aldermen Leonard Robinson had been made chamberlain,
notwithstanding another having been declared
duly elected by the sheriffs, and the Common Hall had
been thereupon dissolved. Nor was this all. The
petitioners went on to complain that divers members of
the Common Council had been illegally excluded, whilst
others who had been duly elected had been refused
admittance; that the place of town clerk having been
vacant for three months and more—an office, they
remind the House, of great trust in the city and one
to which only the Common Council had the right of
appointment—the mayor and aldermen had of their
own authority appointed several persons to execute
the office against the consent of the Common Council;
that the petitioners had not been allowed to meet and
consult about the necessary affairs of the city according
to their ancient rights and customs; and that a Common
Council having met on the 3rd October, and a
majority of the members having agreed upon the
presentation of a humble address to parliament with
the view of explaining the recent Act and settling the
rights of the city, the mayor refused to allow the
question to be put and immediately dissolved the court.
The petitioners therefore, finding all their ancient
rights and privileges thus invaded, prayed the House
to grant them relief. Having heard the petition read
the House ordered a copy of it to be given to the
mayor and aldermen,<a id="noteref_1706" name="noteref_1706" href="#note_1706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1706</span></span></a> and appointed Monday, the 8th
December, for hearing both parties by themselves or
by counsel. Accordingly, on that day the petitioners
were heard by their counsel, and divers witnesses<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page558">[pg 558]</span><a name="Pg558" id="Pg558" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were examined, after which the further hearing was
postponed until the morrow. On the 9th the case of
the mayor and aldermen was opened by counsel and
was continued on the 10th and the 11th, when by a
majority of thirteen it was decided to adjourn the
matter for a week.<a id="noteref_1707" name="noteref_1707" href="#note_1707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1707</span></span></a> It never was taken up again,
parliament being probably unwilling to run the risk of
losing the favour of those in the city who were in
power at a time when interference on its part might
be the cause of stopping the flow of money into the
coffers of the exchequer.<a id="noteref_1708" name="noteref_1708" href="#note_1708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1708</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As early as January, 1690, William had made up
his mind to go to Ireland in person for the purpose of
reducing the country into subjection, but although
every effort was made to push on the necessary preparations
nearly six months elapsed before he was
ready to set out. On the 30th May the assistance of
the City was invoked. The Common Council willingly
agreed to raise money to assist the king in his enterprise,<a id="noteref_1709" name="noteref_1709" href="#note_1709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1709</span></span></a>
and on the 2nd June the mayor waited on his
majesty at Kensington Palace, accompanied by the
recorder, the aldermen and the sheriffs, and wished
him a prosperous journey, promising at the same time
to secure the good government of the city during his
absence.<a id="noteref_1710" name="noteref_1710" href="#note_1710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1710</span></span></a> On the 4th William set sail, and ten days
later (14 June) landed at Carrickfergus. His arrival
was a surprise to James, who flattered himself that
the state of affairs in parliament and "the distractions
of the city" would not allow of his leaving England.<a id="noteref_1711" name="noteref_1711" href="#note_1711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1711</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page559">[pg 559]</span><a name="Pg559" id="Pg559" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
During the king's absence the queen took an active
part in the administration of the kingdom, and by her
tact and kindliness won many friends. As soon as it
was known that William had safely landed in Ireland
the sheriffs were deputed by the Court of Aldermen to
attend her majesty and desire when the court might
wait upon her to offer its congratulations upon the
good fortune that had so far attended the king.<a id="noteref_1712" name="noteref_1712" href="#note_1712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1712</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The defeat of a combined English and Dutch
fleet off Beachy Head on the last day of June caused
a great commotion, although some compensation
was found in the news of William's victory at the
Boyne. Seeing that a French force might any day be
expected in England, the government, as was its wont,
turned to the city of London. On the 7th July the
mayor, the aldermen and some members of the
Court of Lieutenancy<a id="noteref_1713" name="noteref_1713" href="#note_1713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1713</span></span></a> obeyed a summons to attend
upon her majesty in council. The state of affairs
having been fully explained to them, they were asked
as to the numerical strength of the City's militia,
and more especially as to the number of horse and
dragoons the City could raise on an emergency. The
mayor professed himself unable to give a reply off
hand to these questions, and desired time to consult
the Common Council on the matter.<a id="noteref_1714" name="noteref_1714" href="#note_1714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1714</span></span></a> Whatever
political or religious differences existed at the time of
the recent city elections, these were now laid aside in
the face of a common danger, and "London set the
example of concert and of exertion."<a id="noteref_1715" name="noteref_1715" href="#note_1715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1715</span></span></a> No time was
lost. Already the mayor had, in pursuance of an order<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page560">[pg 560]</span><a name="Pg560" id="Pg560" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the Privy Council (3 July) issued precepts to the
several aldermen (5 July) for search to be made in
private as well as public stables for horses for military
service.<a id="noteref_1716" name="noteref_1716" href="#note_1716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1716</span></span></a> On the 10th the Court of Aldermen resolved
to apply to the hackney-men plying their trade in and
about London, and to learn from them the number of
horses they could supply on an emergency like the
present, and upon what terms.<a id="noteref_1717" name="noteref_1717" href="#note_1717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1717</span></span></a> The Common Council
at the same time resolved to raise a regiment of horse
and another of dragoons.<a id="noteref_1718" name="noteref_1718" href="#note_1718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1718</span></span></a> The next day (11 July)
the mayor and aldermen and a deputation of the
lieutenancy again waited upon her majesty sitting
in council and assured her of their loyalty. The
city militia, the queen was informed, consisted of
about 9,000 men, well equipt and ready for active
service, and six regiments of auxiliaries were about
to be raised. As to the horse and dragoons, the
Common Council had unanimously resolved to raise
by voluntary contributions a large regiment of horse
and 1,000 dragoons, and to maintain them for a month
if need be. We have seen how jealous in former days
the city had been in the matter of appointing its own
officers over its own forces, but now all signs of
jealousy were wanting, and the queen herself was
desired to appoint officers over the cavalry that was
in course of being raised.<a id="noteref_1719" name="noteref_1719" href="#note_1719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1719</span></span></a> On the 21st her majesty

assist her majesty by making a speedy loan of £100,000
"or what more can be advanced" on the security of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fortunately for England the French fleet, which
kept hovering for more than a month off the south
coast in the hope of being able to effect a landing, at
last was seen to be sailing homewards. When all
danger was past the queen sent for the lord mayor
(15 Aug.) to thank his lordship and the city for their
readiness in advancing money and raising forces, and
to inform him that there was no immediate necessity
for the horse and dragoons which were then being
raised.<a id="noteref_1722" name="noteref_1722" href="#note_1722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1722</span></span></a></p>

England on Saturday, the 6th, he proceeded by

purpose of attending a congress at the Hague.
Before leaving he gave an audience to the mayor and

and another was on foot. Nevertheless the state of
affairs on the continent would not allow of his
remaining long in England; so, after a brief stay he
again set sail for Holland (2 May), with Marlborough
in his train, to open a regular campaign against the
King of France.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king had not been gone long before the
queen sent to the City (18 June) to borrow £120,000
to be employed in the reduction of Ireland, a business
left to the Dutch General Ginkell, afterwards created
Earl of Athlone, to carry out. The sum of £75,000
was to be advanced on the security of the parliamentary
imposts on wine, vinegar and tobacco, and
the remainder of the loan on the security of similar
imposts on East India goods and other commodities.<a id="noteref_1731" name="noteref_1731" href="#note_1731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1731</span></span></a>
The Common Council readily consented to find the

towards fitting out the fleet.<a id="noteref_1732" name="noteref_1732" href="#note_1732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1732</span></span></a> These advances were,
however, still insufficient to meet the necessities of the

for the winter.<a id="noteref_1733" name="noteref_1733" href="#note_1733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1733</span></span></a> In the following year (1692), when

in the Common Council on the 18th June (immediately
after the court had agreed to lend the queen
£120,000) for repealing the clause in the Act of
Common Council of the 6th June, 1683, touching the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page564">[pg 564]</span><a name="Pg564" id="Pg564" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
confirmation of one of the sheriffs of the city and
county of Middlesex chosen by the mayor for
the time being. A debate thereupon arising the
previous question was put, and was declared by the
lord mayor to be carried. A poll, however, was
demanded, when the previous question was lost by
35 votes to 30, and the original motion being
afterwards put was carried by 30 votes to 29.<a id="noteref_1736" name="noteref_1736" href="#note_1736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1736</span></span></a> Such
is the narrative of what took place in the Common
Council on the 18th June, 1691, as related in the
Journal of the court, according to which the clause
in the Act of 1683 would have been repealed. We
know however, as a matter of fact, that the clause
was not repealed until three years later.<a id="noteref_1737" name="noteref_1737" href="#note_1737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1737</span></span></a> An explanation
is afforded us by Luttrell, the diarist, who says
that the minority against repealing the clause immediately
withdrew from the court "so there were
not enough left to make a Common Council, so the
Act continues in force."<a id="noteref_1738" name="noteref_1738" href="#note_1738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1738</span></span></a> He adds that the mayor
(Pilkington) thereupon went to the Bridge House and
drank to Sir William Ashurst as a "recommendatory
sheriff" for the ensuing year to hold office only on
condition that the choice should be approved by the
Common Hall, "otherwise no good sheriff." When
Midsummer-day arrived, the common sergeant having
asked the Court of Aldermen for instructions as to how
to proceed to the elections, was ordered to "pursue such
directions as he should receive from the sheriffes, and
in his report of the elections, to declare it as the report
of the said sheriffes." The court further ordered that<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page565">[pg 565]</span><a name="Pg565" id="Pg565" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Common Hall should be opened by proclamation
in these words: "You good men of the livery of the
several companies of the city summoned to appear
here this day for the election of sheriffs and other
officers usually chosen at this time, draw near and
give your attendance, etc."<a id="noteref_1739" name="noteref_1739" href="#note_1739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1739</span></span></a> The claims of the
Livery in Common Hall to elect both sheriffs being
thus allowed, the electors were satisfied to pay the
mayor the compliment of electing Sir William
Ashurst, his nominee, to be one of the sheriffs, whilst
choosing Richard Levett to be the other. There
was another candidate in the person of William Gore.
A poll was demanded and allowed, the result of which
was declared on the 2nd July, when it appeared that
Ashurst had polled 3,631 votes, Levett 2,252 and
Gore 1,774. A keen contest again took place between
Sir Peter Rich and Leonard Robinson for the office
of chamberlain, in which the latter came off victorious.<a id="noteref_1740" name="noteref_1740" href="#note_1740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1740</span></span></a></p>

the Court of Aldermen had before them a Bill, the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Bill for regulating the election of members of
the Common Council itself met with better success.
Of late years divers inhabitants of the city who were
not freemen (and among them the doctors and other
gentlemen of Doctors' Commons) had been in the
habit of exercising the franchise at wardmotes, to the
prejudice of freemen, to whom alone belonged the
right of voting. Many complaints having been made
to the Common Council of the rights of freemen
having been thus infringed,<a id="noteref_1743" name="noteref_1743" href="#note_1743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1743</span></span></a> an Act was at length
passed (26 Oct., 1692) declaring that the nomination
of aldermen and the election of common councilmen
for the several wards of the city appertained only to
freemen, being householders in the city, and paying
scot and bearing lot, a list of whom was thenceforth
to be prepared and kept by the beadle of each ward,
as well as a separate list of the other householders.
A copy of the Act was to be appended to all precepts
for wardmotes, and the provisions of the Act were to
be publicly read to the assembled electors.<a id="noteref_1744" name="noteref_1744" href="#note_1744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1744</span></span></a> At the

1691, it was to find Ireland completely subjugated.
The mayor and aldermen waited upon his majesty at

safe arrival. The king thanked them for the care
they had taken of the city during his absence, and
more particularly for supplying the queen with the
sum of £200,000 to enable her to carry on the
necessary affairs of the kingdom, and bestowed the
honour of knighthood on Richard Levett, one of the
sheriffs, Sir William Ashurst, the other sheriff, being
already knighted. Leaving Whitehall, the mayor
and aldermen next proceeded to Kensington to offer
their compliments to the queen and to thank her

in March of the following year (1692) he returned to
the Hague to make preparations for renewing the
war against France both by sea and land, leaving the
queen to carry on the government in England. On
the morning of the 12th March the mayor and
aldermen, accompanied by the recorder, proceeded
to Whitehall to offer the queen their congratulations
upon the receipt of news of the king's safe arrival in
Holland, as well as of her majesty's assumption of the
reins of government. The recorder assured her of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City had not long to wait. Within a week
(18 March) application was made to the Common

that amount already mentioned as having been

to raise the money, and so successful were their efforts
that within four days one-half of the whole loan was
already paid into the exchequer. By the king's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such an occasion was at hand. Whilst England
and Holland were preparing to make a joint attack on
France, France had been getting ready a navy for a
descent on England with the view of restoring James
to the throne. As soon as intelligence arrived of a
threatened invasion great excitement prevailed. This
was towards the close of April (1692). The trained
bands were called out, not only in the city, but
throughout the country, and more especially in those
counties bordering on the coast. The Court of Lieutenancy
had orders to administer the oaths to every
officer and man, and any that refused were to be
instantly cashiered and disarmed. The same with
Papists and all suspicious persons found in the city.
The oaths were to be tendered to them, and if any
refused to take them they were to be disarmed
and banished ten miles from the city.<a id="noteref_1751" name="noteref_1751" href="#note_1751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1751</span></span></a> The mayor

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length—on the 19th May—the French fleet,
which was to cover the invasion of England, met the
combined Dutch and English fleet off La Hogue, and
was so signally beaten that all further thought of an
invasion had to be abandoned. News of the victory
reached London on the 21st, and was received with
every demonstration of joy. Medical aid was at

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The formal announcement of the victory to the

a fitting opportunity for asking for a further loan

"gratify" the seamen who had so gallantly warded
off invasion and to refit the fleet. It need scarcely
be said that the money was readily promised.<a id="noteref_1756" name="noteref_1756" href="#note_1756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1756</span></span></a></p>

promised to summon a Common Council at an early

Kensington. Two days later (22 Oct.) the mayor

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same ill-success followed the arms of the
allied forces this year on the continent as in previous
years. But the fall of Mons in 1691, of Namur in
1692, and the bloody field of Landen this year were
far less disastrous in their effect to the Londoner than
the damage inflicted on the Turkey fleet of merchantmen
in Lagos Bay. For months the fleet, valued at
several millions, had been waiting to be convoyed to
the Mediterranean, and so great had been the delay in
providing it with a sufficiently strong escort that the
city merchant had already lost much of the profit he
had looked to derive from the voyage. When at
length a convoy was provided it was on the understanding
that the greater part of the force should
withdraw as soon as the most critical point of the
voyage should be passed, leaving but barely twenty<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page572">[pg 572]</span><a name="Pg572" id="Pg572" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sail, under Rooke, to accompany the merchantmen
through the Straits of Gibraltar. It was in vain that
Rooke protested. The danger was the more hazardous
inasmuch as no one could say where the French fleet
was lying. Nevertheless, on the 5th June the main
fleet parted company and returned to the Channel,
leaving Rooke, with only seventeen men-of-war, to
look to his charge as best he could. As time went on
and no news could be got of the movements of the
French fleet the underwriters in the city got more
and more nervous.<a id="noteref_1766" name="noteref_1766" href="#note_1766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1766</span></span></a> The end is well known. At Lagos
the English admiral found his passage blocked by the
French fleet. A sharp fight ensued, during which
many merchantmen succeeded in making good their
escape, others were burnt or sunk. "Never within the
memory of man," wrote Macaulay, "had there been
in the city a day of more gloom and agitation than
that on which the news of the encounter in the Bay
of Lagos arrived. Many traders, an eye-witness said,
went away from the Royal Exchange as pale as if
they had received sentence of death." The Turkey
merchants in their distress sent a deputation to the
queen.<a id="noteref_1767" name="noteref_1767" href="#note_1767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1767</span></span></a> The deputation met with a kind reception,
and was assured by Somers, on the queen's behalf, of
her majesty's deep sympathy. An enquiry, he said,
had already been set on foot as to the cause of the
recent disaster, and care would be taken to prevent its
recurrence.</p>

sense of the infinite goodness of God in preserving
the king through all the perils of war, and thanked
her for the sympathy she had displayed with the
ruined merchants and for the steps she had taken
for the better protection of trade in future. To this
address a clause was added at the next meeting of the
court (17 Aug.) referring to their cheerful readiness to
advance a further sum of money for her majesty's
necessities, and assuring her of their firm resolution to
continue upon all occasions to support her authority
and government against all persons to the uttermost
of their power.<a id="noteref_1768" name="noteref_1768" href="#note_1768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1768</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In October the Court of Aldermen invited her

in the new lord mayor, no less than ten aldermen
absented themselves. Whether this was intended for
a studied insult or was the result of mere negligence
does not appear. But, however that may be, the
court marked its sense of their conduct by fining six
of the delinquents 100 marks a-piece, whilst it took<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page574">[pg 574]</span><a name="Pg574" id="Pg574" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after parliament resumed its sittings (7 Nov.,
1693) the attention of the Commons was drawn to a
high-handed act done by the wealthy and autocratic
company known as the East India Company. For
nearly a century that body of merchants had enjoyed
a monopoly of trade with the East Indies and had
frustrated all attempts of "interlopers" to share their
privileges. It had received its first charter at the
hands of Queen Elizabeth on the 31st December, 1600,
but it was not until after the Restoration, when its
privileges were confirmed by another charter, that it
began to enter upon a career of such unexampled
prosperity as to become at once an object of envy and
fear. The management of the company's affairs
rested in the hands of a small number of proprietors,
the leading spirit for many years being Sir Josiah
Child, one of the merchant princes of the city. With
him was associated, at least for a time, Thomas Papillon,
the zealous Whig. He had become a member of the
company as early as 1657, and for many years took
an active part in its management. He was one of the
directors from 1663 to 1670; was re-appointed in 1675,
but lost his seat on the board the following year, as
also did Child, through the intervention of Charles the
Second, who disliked their Whiggish principles. After
a short interval both of them recovered their positions,
and in 1680 and 1681 Papillon was deputy governor.<a id="noteref_1774" name="noteref_1774" href="#note_1774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1774</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page576">[pg 576]</span><a name="Pg576" id="Pg576" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
When Child turned courtier and threw over his old
colleagues, Papillon and other Whig shareholders sold
their stock and severed their connection with the
company. Their places on the directorate were filled
up by others who were devoted to Child and his policy,
and thenceforth Child became the autocrat of the
company. "The treasures of the company were
absolutely at his disposal.... A present of ten
thousand guineas was graciously received from him
by Charles. Ten thousand more were accepted by
James, who readily consented to become a holder of
stock.... Of what the dictator expended
no account was asked by his colleagues."<a id="noteref_1775" name="noteref_1775" href="#note_1775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1775</span></span></a> His
policy was so far successful as to obtain a decision
in favour of the company's privileges from Jeffreys
and a renewal of its charter from James. Just at
a time when the prospects of the company looked
brightest a sudden change of fortune was occasioned
by the Revolution and the subsequent accession of the
Whigs to power. The outcry raised by the general
merchants of the city against the company became
louder than ever, not so much on account of the company
being in possession of a monopoly as because it
was ruled by a single individual, and his rule, while
benefiting himself and his creatures, was prejudicial to
the public welfare. To this outcry Papillon, who had
now returned from exile, added his voice and thereby
subjected himself to a charge of inconsistency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was but one remedy for the existing evil
in the opinion of the majority, and that was to form
a new company from which Child should be excluded.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page577">[pg 577]</span><a name="Pg577" id="Pg577" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Without waiting for an Act of Parliament many traders
in the city formed themselves into an association
which, although unrecognised by law, acquired the
designation of the New Company, and commenced to
carry on its business at the hall of the Skinners' Company
in Dowgate. For years the city was kept in a
ferment by the rivalry existing between the Old and
the New Company, between Leadenhall Street and
Skinners' Hall, the former being supported by the
Tories, the latter by the Whigs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sanction and assistance of parliament was
sought for by both companies. The majority of the
Commons were in favour of a compromise. They
would have retained the Old Company, but wished to
remodel it and to incorporate with it the members of
the New Company. Such a proceeding, however, Child
would not listen to, and his obstinacy so provoked
the House that in February, 1692, it presented an
address to the king praying him to dissolve the Old
Company and to grant a charter to a New Company on
such terms as to his majesty's wisdom might seem fit.
The king replied that it was a matter of very great
importance to the trade of the kingdom; that he
could not be expected to give an immediate answer,
but he would consider the matter and give an answer
shortly.<a id="noteref_1776" name="noteref_1776" href="#note_1776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1776</span></span></a> The company sought to avert the impending
danger by offering the king the sum of £200,000 by
way of loan for three years without any interest.<a id="noteref_1777" name="noteref_1777" href="#note_1777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1777</span></span></a> A
twelvemonth later (Feb., 1693) the Commons again
petitioned the king to dissolve the Old Company upon<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page578">[pg 578]</span><a name="Pg578" id="Pg578" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
three years' warning;<a id="noteref_1778" name="noteref_1778" href="#note_1778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1778</span></span></a> but in spite of these attacks
the company contrived to obtain a confirmation of
its monopoly under the Great Seal in the following

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the management of the Old
Company's affairs had been placed ostensibly in the
hands of Sir Thomas Cook,<a id="noteref_1780" name="noteref_1780" href="#note_1780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1780</span></span></a> an alderman of London

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within a few days of the order of the Privy
Council for sealing the company's charter, and before
the king, whose return from the continent was daily
expected, could give it his sanction,<a id="noteref_1781" name="noteref_1781" href="#note_1781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1781</span></span></a> the directors, in
the moment of victory, committed an act of incredible
rashness which led to serious consequences. A number
of city merchants had recently chartered a vessel
named "Redbridge" and placed on board a valuable
cargo. Her papers showed her to be bound for a
Spanish port, but suspicion pointed to her being
intended for a voyage to the East Indies in contravention
of the company's charter. Acting on this
surmise, the company procured an order from the
Privy Council to have the vessel stopt, and stopt<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page579">[pg 579]</span><a name="Pg579" id="Pg579" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
she accordingly was from the 21st October until the
following 9th November, each day's delay in sailing
inflicting heavy expense on the owners. Such high-handed
proceedings of the Company might create
little excitement if carried out on the high seas and
at a distance from home, but in the port of London
they were not to be tolerated. The owners of the
"Redbridge" laid their grievance before the Commons
(30 Dec.).<a id="noteref_1782" name="noteref_1782" href="#note_1782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1782</span></span></a> They pointed out that the conduct of
the East India Company was "greatly prejudicial to
all foreign trade and navigation in general, and more
particularly to the petitioners, who by the present
laws of the kingdom can have no reparation." They
prayed, therefore, that the like inconveniences might be
prevented for the future. Their petition was referred
to a committee of the whole House, together with other
petitions against the company, as well as the company's
charters. In due course the committee, with Papillon
in the chair, reported that the stopping of the "Redbridge"
was "a grievance, a discouragement to trade
and contrary to the known laws of the kingdom,"<a id="noteref_1783" name="noteref_1783" href="#note_1783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1783</span></span></a>
and further that, in the opinion of the Common Hall,
"all the subjects of England have equal right to trade
to the East Indies unless prohibited by Act of
Parliament." This resolution was accepted by the
House without a division,<a id="noteref_1784" name="noteref_1784" href="#note_1784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1784</span></span></a> and for some years at least

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between March, 1689, and February, 1691, little
appears to have been done towards solving the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page580">[pg 580]</span><a name="Pg580" id="Pg580" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
difficulty of the claims of the City orphans. Another
committee was appointed at the expiration of that
time to consider the matter, and in November, 1691,
the committee reported to the Common Council.
They recommended that certain rents of the value
of £8,000 per annum should be set aside towards
the payment of four per cent. per annum for the
immediate relief of the orphans, and that parliament
should be asked to authorise the raising of a sum of
£24,000 to be vested in the Corporation for the
satisfaction of debts to existing orphans, and for
security of the money of orphans that should be paid
into the Chamber in future. The recommendation of
the committee was accepted by the court (20 Nov.),
and three days later a draft petition to parliament
was read and approved.<a id="noteref_1786" name="noteref_1786" href="#note_1786"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1786</span></span></a> The petition set forth that
in the troublous times during and after the reign of
Charles I the City lost divers large sums of money,
and that by reason of this, as well as of the destruction
of the greatest part of their estate in the great fire
and their losses consequent on the illegal judgment
on the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</span></span>, their debts to the orphans had
amounted to a sum far larger than the City was able
to pay without the assistance of parliament. It
proceeded to lay before the House the scheme proposed
by the committee, and prayed the House to
assist the petitioners to raise a sufficient sum for an
annual payment to be made in lieu of the said debts, or
such other provision for the same as the House might
think fit. On the 27th November leave was granted
to bring in a Bill, and on the 3rd December a Bill was
brought in and read the first time, but nothing further<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page581">[pg 581]</span><a name="Pg581" id="Pg581" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

1692, a committee was appointed to consider the
question how best the City's revenues might be improved
with the view to the easier discharge of
orphans' claims. The committee showed itself very
active, meeting at least once and often twice a week.
Nevertheless it was not until the 2nd November it
was in a position to make a report to the Common
Council.<a id="noteref_1788" name="noteref_1788" href="#note_1788"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1788</span></span></a> What was thought of the committee's

read the second time on the 22nd and committed.

been paid into the exchequer.<a id="noteref_1797" name="noteref_1797" href="#note_1797"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1797</span></span></a> The money was raised
in the usual way from the inhabitants of each ward
and from the livery companies. The Corporation
itself was by no means well off, and encouragement
was given to anyone who could suggest a means
whereby the City's revenues could be increased.<a id="noteref_1798" name="noteref_1798" href="#note_1798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1798</span></span></a>
Recourse was had, among other things, to nominating
for sheriff the least suitable men for the office, and
such as would prefer paying the fine to serving. In
no other way can one reasonably account for the fact
that the fines for refusing to undertake the office of
sheriff amounted for this year (1694) to over £5,000.<a id="noteref_1799" name="noteref_1799" href="#note_1799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1799</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This loan was but as a drop in the ocean compared
with the necessities of the times. The estimates for
the year 1694 were enormous. The army, which was
already the largest standing force that England had
ever seen, was to receive a large increase, whilst
considerable sums of money were required for payment
of arrears, no less than for the future expenses,
of the navy. Notwithstanding the renewal of the land
tax, the imposition of a poll-tax, the revival of stamp
duties, and the raising of a million of money by a lottery
loan, there yet remained a large deficit before the estimated
revenue of the year balanced the estimated
expenditure. At this juncture Charles Montague, poet,
politician and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">savant</span></span>, took up a scheme propounded
to government three years before by William Paterson,
an enterprising if not always successful Scotsman,
but allowed to drop. This scheme was none other
than the formation of a national bank. The idea was
not altogether a new one. Before the close of the
reign of Charles II several plans of the kind had been
suggested, some being in favour of establishing such a
bank under the immediate direction of the Crown,
whilst others were of opinion that its management
should be entrusted to the Corporation of the city.
It was now proposed to raise the sum of £1,200,000
for the use of the government by way of loan at
eight per cent. interest, the subscribers being incorporated
by the name of the Governor and Company
of the Bank of England. The matter was introduced
into parliament for the first time on the 28th March,
in the shape of a Bill for granting their majesties
certain tonnage duties on wine, ale and other liquors.<a id="noteref_1800" name="noteref_1800" href="#note_1800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1800</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page585">[pg 585]</span><a name="Pg585" id="Pg585" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Although it was not easy to recognise in the terms of
the Bill the germ of "the greatest commercial institution
that the world had ever seen,"<a id="noteref_1801" name="noteref_1801" href="#note_1801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1801</span></span></a> it met with
considerable opposition in the House, and still more
outside. With their recent experience of the evils
arising from a rich and powerful body like the East
India Company, men were cautious in allowing a
Corporation to be erected in their midst which, as
many feared, would absorb the wealth of the nation,<a id="noteref_1802" name="noteref_1802" href="#note_1802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1802</span></span></a>
and might render the Crown independent of parliament
and people. This last consideration was not unimportant,
and, in order to avert the possibility of such
a danger, a clause was inserted in the Bill forbidding
under the severest penalties the new Corporation
advancing money to the Crown without the authority
of parliament.<a id="noteref_1803" name="noteref_1803" href="#note_1803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1803</span></span></a> Subject to this and other conditions
the Bill passed the Commons, and on the 24th April
was agreed to by the Lords.<a id="noteref_1804" name="noteref_1804" href="#note_1804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1804</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the head of the Commission, issued under the
Great Seal for the establishment of the new bank, stood
the name of the lord mayor, Sir William Ashurst; and
out of the twenty-four original directors at least four
rose to be chief magistrate of the city, whilst others
are known to have taken an active part in the affairs
of the municipality.<a id="noteref_1805" name="noteref_1805" href="#note_1805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1805</span></span></a> In the city the undertaking met
with a success beyond all expectation. The very first
day (21 June) that the subscription lists were opened
at Mercers' Hall nearly £300,000 was received, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page586">[pg 586]</span><a name="Pg586" id="Pg586" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
within a week that amount was doubled. Sir John
Houblon, who succeeded to the mayoralty the following
year, and became the first Governor of the Bank,
subscribed £10,000, the largest amount any one
individual was allowed by the terms of the charter to
subscribe before the first day of July. The same
amount was subscribed by the lords of the treasury on
behalf of the queen. By mid-day of the 2nd July the
whole of the money (£1,200,000) had been subscribed
and the books closed.<a id="noteref_1806" name="noteref_1806" href="#note_1806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1806</span></span></a> The Great Seal was put to the
bank charter, and business was commenced in the hall
of the Grocers' Company.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto, as we have seen, the city of London
had always acted (as indeed it claimed to be) as the
king's Chamber, and the occupier of the throne of
England for the time being had never hesitated to
draw upon this Chamber whenever he was in need of
money. The mode of procedure was nearly always
the same. The lords of the treasury would appear
some morning before the Common Council, and after
a few words of explanation as to the necessities of the
time, would ask for a loan, offering in most cases (we
are bound to confess) undeniable security. Supposing
that the Council agreed to raise the required loan,
which it nearly always did, the mayor for the time
being was usually instructed to issue his precept to the
aldermen to collect subscriptions within their several
wards, whilst other precepts were (in later times at
least) sent to the master or wardens of the livery
companies to do the same among the members of
their companies. There were times, also, when the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page587">[pg 587]</span><a name="Pg587" id="Pg587" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
companies were called upon to subscribe in proportion
to their assessment for supplying the city with corn in
times of distress.<a id="noteref_1807" name="noteref_1807" href="#note_1807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1807</span></span></a> Times were now changed. Instead
of applying to the City for an advance in case of need,
the king thenceforth drew what he required from the
Bank of England. During the remainder of his reign
William only applied twice to the City for a loan:
once, towards the close of 1696, when he required
money for the army and navy, and again in 1697,
when it was necessary to pay off his continental allies
and lay up the navy after the peace of Ryswick
(10 Sept.).<a id="noteref_1808" name="noteref_1808" href="#note_1808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1808</span></span></a> The City, in its corporate capacity, was

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In December of this year (1694)—soon after his
return from an unsuccessful campaign—William
suffered an irreparable loss by the death of the
queen. The old adage touching an ill wind received a
curious exemplification at Queen Mary's death, for
although that event sent down the stock of the Bank
of England three per cent., it benefited the East
India Company by causing a rapid rise in the price of
muslin, a commodity of which we are told that
company happened to possess a large quantity.<a id="noteref_1809" name="noteref_1809" href="#note_1809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1809</span></span></a> The

whilst the Common Council voted an address of condolence
to the king and ordered statues ("effigies")

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The funeral did not take place until the 6th
March (1695). In anticipation of that event the
Court of Aldermen had some time since (18 Jan.)
appointed a committee to consider of the right and
title of the lord mayor, aldermen and sheriffs of the
city to their mourning and their places in the funeral
procession, as also of the mourning due to the several
officers of the city. Four days later (22 Jan.) the
committee reported<a id="noteref_1813" name="noteref_1813" href="#note_1813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1813</span></span></a> to the effect that they had
found from the records of the city that it had been
the custom for the lord mayor, aldermen, recorder,
sheriffs and the principal and other officers of the
city to have mourning allowed them by the Crown at
the public interments of kings and queens, but as to
the places and precedency of the lord mayor and
aldermen on those occasions the committee had only
found one instance of a funeral procession, and that
was at the funeral of Henry VII, when it appeared
that the aldermen walked "next after the knights
and before the great chaplains of dignitys and the
knights of the garter being noe lords." The lord
mayor (the report went on to say) was not named in
the procession, but at the mass and offering at the
interment it appeared that the lord mayor, with his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page589">[pg 589]</span><a name="Pg589" id="Pg589" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mace in hand, offered next after the lord chamberlain,
and the aldermen who had been mayors offered next
to the knights of the garter and before the knights of
the body, after whom came those aldermen who had
not been lord mayor.<a id="noteref_1814" name="noteref_1814" href="#note_1814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1814</span></span></a> The committee concluded
their report by recommending that a deputation
should wait upon the Privy Council and assert the
right of the Court of Aldermen to mourning. The
representation thereupon made had the desired effect
and the usual mourning was allowed by warrant
(29 Jan.).<a id="noteref_1815" name="noteref_1815" href="#note_1815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1815</span></span></a> The citizens marked their respect for the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The session of 1695 of William's first parliament
was signalised by the discovery of a system of wholesale
corruption. That every man had his price was
scarcely less true in William's day than it was in the
later age of Sir Robert Walpole. The discovery of
one delinquent guilty of receiving money for services,
real or supposed, quickly led to another, until suspicion
turned upon the City of London itself. A rumour
rapidly gained ground to the effect that the funds of
the City as well as those of the East India Company
had been largely employed in winning the favour of
men in power, and the name of Sir John Trevor, the
Speaker of the House of Commons, was mentioned
among others.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 7th March the House appointed a committee
to investigate the matter, with power to send
for persons and papers.<a id="noteref_1817" name="noteref_1817" href="#note_1817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1817</span></span></a> On the 12th the committee
reported to the House that they had discovered an<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page590">[pg 590]</span><a name="Pg590" id="Pg590" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
order of a committee appointed by the Corporation
for the purpose of seeing the Orphans' Bill through
parliament, dated the 12th February, 1694, authorising
the payment of 1,000 guineas to the Speaker, Sir John
Trevor, as soon as the Bill should pass. This order,
they said, was signed by every member of the
committee except Sir James Houblon and Mr. Deputy
Ayres, and was endorsed to the effect that the
money had been delivered and paid to the Hon.
Sir John Trevor on the 22nd June, 1694, in the
presence of Sir Robert Clayton and Sir James
Houblon, brother of Sir John.<a id="noteref_1818" name="noteref_1818" href="#note_1818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1818</span></span></a> When summoned to
account for his having refused to sign the order of
the committee whilst allowing himself to witness
the actual payment of the money to the Speaker,
Sir James excused himself by saying that he had
accompanied Sir Robert Clayton, at the latter's
request, professedly for the purpose of thanking the
Speaker for his pains about the Orphans' Bill; that
this being done, the Chamberlain, who had gone with
them, pulled out a note or bill which he handed to
the Speaker, but as to the nature of the note or bill
Houblon declared himself to have been ignorant until
subsequently informed by the Chamberlain. Other<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page591">[pg 591]</span><a name="Pg591" id="Pg591" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
members of the Corporation Committee also gave
evidence as to the warrant for payment of the money
having been originally made out with a blank space
left for the name of the payee. The report further
declared that sums of money had been paid to Paul
Godrell, clerk of the House of Commons, to the city
solicitor, the solicitor-general and the chairman of
the Corporation Committee in respect of the Orphans'
Bill, whilst the orphans themselves had been prevailed
upon to give security for the payment of five per cent.
on their whole property to certain other parties who
professed to be able to render valuable services in
the event of the Bill being passed.<a id="noteref_1819" name="noteref_1819" href="#note_1819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1819</span></span></a></p>

report to the House was finished it was growing dusk,
and candles were called for. A resolution was then
moved and put to the house by Trevor himself, that
the Speaker, by receiving a gratuity of 1,000 guineas
from the city of London after passing of the Orphans'
Bill, had been guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour.
The resolution was passed, and four days
later (16 March) Trevor was expelled the House.<a id="noteref_1820" name="noteref_1820" href="#note_1820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1820</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A month later (18 April) the House of Lords were
busy investigating the conduct of the Marquis of
Normanby in accepting, and of the Corporation of the
City in granting, a lease of a certain plot of land lying
behind Clarendon House, part of the City's estate
known as Conduit Mead. It was shown by oral and
documentary evidence that a longer lease than usual
had recently been granted (Jan., 1695) to the marquis
as "a gratification," he being a person of distinction<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page592">[pg 592]</span><a name="Pg592" id="Pg592" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who had shown himself very friendly to the interests
of the City and likely to continue so.<a id="noteref_1821" name="noteref_1821" href="#note_1821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1821</span></span></a> Negotiations
for a lease had been commenced so far back as
January, 1694, "before the Orphans' Bill was on the
anvill in the House of Commons."<a id="noteref_1822" name="noteref_1822" href="#note_1822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1822</span></span></a> It was not denied
that the City entertained the hope that the marquis
would use his interest in expediting the passage of
the Bill, and that this hope had been realised. On
the other hand it was shown that when the marquis
learnt that one of the conditions of the lease was
that he should "covenant" to procure an Act of
Parliament for settling some doubts of title to the
land conveyed, he at once declared that such a thing
was not in his power, but lay with the king, the lords
and the commons; nevertheless, he consented to use
his best endeavours in that direction. The marquis,
it was said, had also been indiscreet enough to divulge
certain proceedings of the House of Lords in the
matter of the Convex Lights, and this formed the
subject of an investigation by the House at the same
time as the granting of this lease. After careful
consideration the House entirely acquitted his lordship
of blame in both cases.<a id="noteref_1823" name="noteref_1823" href="#note_1823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1823</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In considering the City's action in respect of the
Orphans' Bill we must not forget to take into account
the condition of the age. It was one in which
peculation and venality were predominant. Nearly
every official who was worth the buying could be
bought, and the world thought none the worse of
him provided that these pecuniary transactions were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page593">[pg 593]</span><a name="Pg593" id="Pg593" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
kept decently veiled. The "gifts and rewards"
bestowed by the City with the object of expediting
the passage of the Orphans' Bill were as nothing
compared with the vast sums which the East India
Company was reported to have disbursed in order
to obtain the confirmation of its charter. It was the
practice when Sir Thomas Cook was in power
for the directors of the company to sign warrants
for any sum that he might require without demanding
particulars from him. In seven years (1688-1694)
more than £100,000 had been disposed of for
the company's "special service," nearly £90,000 of
which had been disbursed whilst Cook was governor
(1692-1693).<a id="noteref_1824" name="noteref_1824" href="#note_1824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1824</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A parliamentary committee endeavoured to obtain
some account as to how this large sum of money had
been expended, but could learn nothing more than that
it had been spent on the "special service" of the company
and that a great part of it had been entrusted to
Sir Basil Firebrace.<a id="noteref_1825" name="noteref_1825" href="#note_1825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1825</span></span></a> Firebrace denied this, but confessed
to having received upwards of £16,000 for which
he had accounted to the company. The committee's
report proceeded to inform the House that the company
had spent considerable sums of money, under the guise
of contracts, in buying up the interests of "interlopers"
and getting them to join the company. They had
found Sir Samuel Dashwood, Sir John Fleet, Sir
Thomas Cook (all aldermen of the city), Sir Joseph
Herne and John Perry to have been cognisant of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page594">[pg 594]</span><a name="Pg594" id="Pg594" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these proceedings, but they being members of parliament
the committee did not think fit to send for or
examine them.<a id="noteref_1826" name="noteref_1826" href="#note_1826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1826</span></span></a> Acting upon the committee's report,
the House called upon Sir Thomas Cook (26 March)
to give an account of the sum of £87,000 which he
had received of the company's money, and upon his
refusing committed him to the Tower.<a id="noteref_1827" name="noteref_1827" href="#note_1827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1827</span></span></a> A Bill was

strongest denunciation by the Duke of Leeds (who
saw in it considerable danger to himself), as also
by Cook himself, who was brought from the Tower
for the purpose of allowing him to plead against
the passing of such a Bill. At the Bar of the
House the latter earnestly implored the Peers not
to pass the Bill in its present form. Let them
pass a Bill of Indemnity and he would tell them
all. The Lords considered his request reasonable,
and after a conference with the Lower House it was
agreed that the Bill should take the form of an
Indemnity Bill, and so it was passed (19 April), a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His examination, which took place in the Exchequer
Chamber on the 23rd April, confirmed the
committee's previous suspicions.<a id="noteref_1830" name="noteref_1830" href="#note_1830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1830</span></span></a> The sum of £10,000<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page595">[pg 595]</span><a name="Pg595" id="Pg595" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had been paid (he said) to Sir Basil Firebrace about
November, 1693, when the charter of the East India
Company had been confirmed, and he had always
been under the apprehension that Firebrace had
pocketed the money "to recompense his losses in the
interloping trade." A further sum of £30,000 had
been paid to Firebrace on various contracts. There
had been a contract involving the payment of £60,000
on account of procuring a new charter, and another
of the value of £40,000 on account of getting the
charter sanctioned by an Act of Parliament, but as
no Act was passed this latter contract fell through.
There was a further sum of £30,000 which had been
lost to the company on account of certain stock it
had agreed to purchase from Firebrace at the price of
£150 per cent. at a time when the company's stock
was standing at par. Firebrace had always refused
to give him any account as to how this money was
disposed of, and had declared that "if he were
further pressed he would have no more to do in it."
Such was the sum and substance of Cook's confession
so far as it affected Firebrace.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day (24 April) Firebrace appeared
before the committee. As to the £10,000 he had
received from Cook, that was (he said) a gratuity
which had been given to him before the granting of
the charter. The other sum of £30,000 was due on
a contract "for favours and services done." He was
positive that both sums were intended "directly for
himself and for the use of no other person whatsoever";
that he paid nothing thereout towards
procuring either charter or Act, nor had promised to
do so. He acknowledged himself to have been very<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page596">[pg 596]</span><a name="Pg596" id="Pg596" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
active in his endeavours to gain over interlopers, and
to improve the stock of the company, but when
pressed by the committee for particulars he asked to
be excused giving an immediate answer on the score
of ill-health; he had not slept for two nights and was
much indisposed.<a id="noteref_1831" name="noteref_1831" href="#note_1831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1831</span></span></a> On the 25th and following day
he was well enough to volunteer further evidence
incriminating the Duke of Leeds. He told the
committee of an interview he (Firebrace) had had
with Sir Thomas Cook, when the latter expressed
his apprehension lest the passing the East India
Company's charter should be opposed by the lord
president. They had then agreed to endeavour to
win his lordship's favour by an offer of 5,000 guineas.
That sum had been actually left at the duke's house,
and it was only returned on the morning the enquiry
opened. After the payment of the money both
Cook and himself had enjoyed free access to the
duke and found him willing to give them his
assistance.<a id="noteref_1832" name="noteref_1832" href="#note_1832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1832</span></span></a></p>

himself, who acknowledged that he had suggested an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Sunday the 12th May, 1695, William again
set out for the continent, and did not return until the
10th October. The great feature of the campaign
was the brilliant siege and recovery of the town of
Namur, which had been lost to the allied forces three
years before. Baulked in a proposed design against
the king's person by his unexpected departure, the
Jacobites had to content themselves with other
measures. On the 10th June, the birthday of the
unfortunate Prince of Wales, a number of them met
at a tavern in Drury Lane. Excited by wine they
sallied forth, with drums beating and colours flying,
and insisted on passers by drinking the prince's health.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page598">[pg 598]</span><a name="Pg598" id="Pg598" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This roused the indignation of the neighbours, who
sacked the tavern and put the revellers to flight, one of
the ringleaders being seized and afterwards committed
to Newgate.<a id="noteref_1839" name="noteref_1839" href="#note_1839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1839</span></span></a> When, in the following August, the whole
of London was on the tiptoe of excitement, waiting for
news of the fall of Namur, the citizens were suddenly
amazed at the sight of a horseman in military uniform
riding through the main streets and announcing that
William had been killed. That the wish was father
to the thought became sufficiently clear to the
by-standers when they heard the man declare with
pistol in hand and sword drawn that he would kill
anyone who denied the truth of his statement. A
serious disturbance was avoided by his being incontinently
dragged from his horse and carried before
the lord mayor, who committed him to prison.<a id="noteref_1840" name="noteref_1840" href="#note_1840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1840</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the king returned in October, with the
laurels of victory fresh on his brow, he determined
to seize the favourable opportunity for dissolving
parliament. The result of the elections for a new
parliament—the first triennial parliament under a
recent Act—justified the course he had taken. The
citizens, who had been among the first to welcome
him on his arrival in London, and whose sheriffs—Edward
Wills and Owen Buckingham—he had recently
knighted,<a id="noteref_1841" name="noteref_1841" href="#note_1841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1841</span></span></a> instead of returning Tory members, as in
the late parliament, returned four Whigs, viz., three
aldermen, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir John Fleet and
Sir William Ashurst, and one commoner, Thomas
Papillon. The election was strongly contested, a poll
being demanded by three other candidates, viz., Sir<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page599">[pg 599]</span><a name="Pg599" id="Pg599" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
William Pritchard, Sir Thomas Vernon and Sir William
Russell, against the return of Clayton, Ashurst and
Papillon. The result of the poll, however, left matters
undisturbed.<a id="noteref_1842" name="noteref_1842" href="#note_1842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1842</span></span></a> The contest in Westminster was more
severe than in the city, but, like the latter, ended in a
victory for the Whigs. Cook, who was still a prisoner
in the Tower, again contested Colchester, but lost his
seat.<a id="noteref_1843" name="noteref_1843" href="#note_1843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1843</span></span></a> On the 22nd November the Houses met.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's return was a signal for fresh action
on the part of the Jacobites. It was resolved to
assassinate William on his return from hunting in
Richmond Park. The management of the conspiracy
was entrusted to Sir George Barclay, a Scotch
refugee, who succeeded in getting together a small
band of men willing to take part in the desperate
enterprise. The plot was, however, discovered, and
some of the leading conspirators arrested. On the
evening of Sunday the 23rd February (1696) the lord
mayor (Sir John Houblon) was summoned to the
Privy Council and informed of the narrow escape of
the king. He was charged to look well to the safety
of the city. On Monday morning all the city trained
bands were under arms, and on Tuesday the Common
Council voted a congratulatory address to the king
upon his escape.<a id="noteref_1844" name="noteref_1844" href="#note_1844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1844</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By that time parliament had been informed of
what had taken place. The Commons immediately
suspended the Habeas Corpus Act and agreed to enter
into an association for the defence of their king and
country. An instrument was forthwith drawn up<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page600">[pg 600]</span><a name="Pg600" id="Pg600" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whereby each individual member of the House pledged
himself to uphold King William and William's government
against James and his adherents, and in case
his majesty should meet with a violent death to unite
with one another in inflicting condign vengeance on
his murderers, and in supporting the order of succession
to the crown as settled by the Bill of Rights. On
Tuesday (25 Feb.) the House was called over; the
association engrossed on parchment lay on the table,
and every member present went up and signed, those
who from sickness or other cause were absent being
ordered to sign the document on their first appearance
in the House, or publicly declare from their seat in
the House their refusal to do so.<a id="noteref_1845" name="noteref_1845" href="#note_1845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1845</span></span></a> The next day the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For weeks and months strict search was made in
the city for Papists and suspect persons,<a id="noteref_1847" name="noteref_1847" href="#note_1847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1847</span></span></a> and among
them for Sir John Fenwick, for whose arrest a proclamation
was issued on the 22nd March.<a id="noteref_1848" name="noteref_1848" href="#note_1848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1848</span></span></a> He was
eventually captured whilst making his way to the
coast for the purpose of escaping to France, and was
committed to Newgate. When a motion was made
in November for proceeding against him by Bill of
Attainder the sheriffs of London surrendered their
charge to the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons.
After his execution on Tower Hill in January<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page601">[pg 601]</span><a name="Pg601" id="Pg601" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the following year (1697) some officers of Sheriff
Blewet, whose duty it had been to keep watch over
Fenwick by night and day whilst lying in Newgate,
had to apply to the Court of Aldermen before they
could get the sheriff to pay them the money (£9 10<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span>)
due to them for that service.<a id="noteref_1849" name="noteref_1849" href="#note_1849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1849</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discovery of the assassination plot had the
result of rendering William's seat on the throne more
secure than ever, and won for him the unqualified
support of parliament. Early in February (1696) a
Bill had been brought in to exclude from the House
every person who did not possess a certain estate in
land. The Bill met with much opposition in commercial
circles, and more especially in the city of
London,<a id="noteref_1850" name="noteref_1850" href="#note_1850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1850</span></span></a> and the king being unwilling to estrange
those merchants and traders who had so often assisted
him, exercised his prerogative and declined to give his
assent to the Bill. Thereupon some violent Tories
moved that whoever advised the king to take this
course was an enemy to him and the nation; but the
House displayed its loyalty by rejecting the motion
by an overwhelming majority and ordering the division
list to be published.<a id="noteref_1851" name="noteref_1851" href="#note_1851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1851</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The City was not behindhand in renewing its
assurances of loyalty. The liverymen of the several
companies assembled in the Guildhall for the election
of a mayor on Michaelmas-day passed a resolution to
stand by the king with their lives and fortunes, and
desired the city members of parliament to see that a
searching enquiry were made into the late conspiracy<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page602">[pg 602]</span><a name="Pg602" id="Pg602" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time when this resolution was passed the
king was expected home from the continent, whither
he had gone in May last. During his absence there
had occurred a monetary crisis—the first since the
establishment of the Bank of England—which, after
causing for several months a great amount of distress,
was destined to be succeeded by a long period of
unbroken prosperity. An Act had recently been
passed for calling in all clipt money and substituting
milled money in its stead,<a id="noteref_1853" name="noteref_1853" href="#note_1853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1853</span></span></a> and the crisis was brought
about by the old money being called in before the new
money was ready for issue. Saturday, the 2nd May,
was practically the last day clipt money was received
by the exchequer. Three days later the stock of
milled money in the coffers of the Bank of England
at Grocers' Hall had run out, and the governor of the
Bank, Sir John Houblon, who happened at the time
to be also lord mayor, had to propitiate the numerous
claimants for the new money by offering them part
payment in the old coin and the rest in the new as
soon as it was minted.<a id="noteref_1854" name="noteref_1854" href="#note_1854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1854</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the end of July matters became worse.
In spite of the extraordinary activity displayed by the
Mint authorities, at the Tower and in divers parts of
the country, the supply had not equalled the demand,
yet a large sum of money was now imperatively
demanded for payment of the army on the continent.
The king himself had written to say that unless the
money was forthcoming his troops were ready to
mutiny or desert. Nothing less than a million would
satisfy the requirements of the army in Flanders, a
like sum was wanted for the navy, whilst half that
amount was necessary for the army in England.<a id="noteref_1855" name="noteref_1855" href="#note_1855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1855</span></span></a>
How was this enormous sum to be raised? It was
thought that the City might vote something towards
it, but the Chamberlain declared that any proposal
for a loan at that time would with difficulty be
carried into execution owing to the scarcity of money.<a id="noteref_1856" name="noteref_1856" href="#note_1856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1856</span></span></a>
Some private individuals, however, managed to raise
£200,000 for the king, whilst others, like Sir Josiah
Child, Charles Duncombe and Sir Joseph Herne, were
prepared to stand security for £300,000 more, which
the Dutch were ready to advance. After long deliberation
the Bank of England agreed (15 Aug.) to advance
another £200,000.<a id="noteref_1857" name="noteref_1857" href="#note_1857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1857</span></span></a> These sums sufficed for the more
immediate wants of the king, and allowed time for
the issue of the new currency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The campaign of 1696 had been carried on in a
very desultory way. All parties were anxious for a
peace. Towards the end of April, 1697, William once
more crossed over to Flanders,<a id="noteref_1858" name="noteref_1858" href="#note_1858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1858</span></span></a> and the French king

to terms, it was arranged that a congress should meet
near the Hague. The result of the congress was the
conclusion (10 Sept.) of the Peace of Ryswick,
whereby Louis consented to acknowledge William's
title to the throne. The news was received in the
city four days later with every demonstration of joy;
the Tower guns were discharged, flags hung out, bells
set ringing and bonfires lighted.<a id="noteref_1859" name="noteref_1859" href="#note_1859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1859</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Court of Aldermen resolved to give the
king a more than ordinary reception on his return.
Search was made for precedents as to the manner in
which former kings had been received on their return
from progresses or from parts beyond the sea, and
these precedents, from the time of Edward IV down
to that of King Charles II, were duly reported to the
court by a committee appointed to make the search.<a id="noteref_1860" name="noteref_1860" href="#note_1860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1860</span></span></a>
The committee was next instructed to consider of
suitable ways and methods for the reception of his
majesty if he should be pleased to pass through the
city, and on this also the committee reported with
elaborate detail.<a id="noteref_1861" name="noteref_1861" href="#note_1861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1861</span></span></a> These and other preparations were
all made under the apprehension that the king was
about to return immediately. Weeks went by and
no king appeared. The Court of Aldermen availed
themselves of the delay to put the finishing touches
to the programme of welcome that was to be accorded
him, and to commit into custody any suspicious
character they found.<a id="noteref_1862" name="noteref_1862" href="#note_1862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1862</span></span></a> At length, after long and

one of the finest sights that had ever been seen in the
city of London, famous as it always had been for its
pageantry. No expense had been spared in providing
new gowns for the magistrates and new banners for the
companies. The mayor, aldermen and sheriffs rode
out "in their formalities" as far as Southwark, where
they met the king, and where the usual ceremony
took place of surrendering the civic sword into his
majesty's hands, to be immediately returned to the
lord mayor. This done, the procession was formed,
and the king was escorted with trumpets and kettle-drums
through the entire length of the city, the
streets being guarded by the six regiments of trained
bands, and the houses rendered bright with hangings
of tapestry.<a id="noteref_1867" name="noteref_1867" href="#note_1867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1867</span></span></a></p>

attended in state. The king did not attend lest his

run its course and a new election of members for the
city took place all the old members retained their
seats except Sir Robert Clayton. His place was
taken by Sir James Houblon, a Tory. On this
occasion the election for the city did not take place
until the returns of many constituencies in the country
had been made known. As a rule the returns of the
metropolitan constituencies were looked forward to
as an augury of the political complexion of the
coming parliament. This parliament was not allowed
to live its full time, but was dissolved in December,
1700, a new parliament being summoned to meet in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page607">[pg 607]</span><a name="Pg607" id="Pg607" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the death of James II at St. Germains
(5 Sept., 1701) Louis broke his vow (made at
Ryswick) not to do anything to disturb or subvert
the government of England, and forthwith proclaimed
the late king's son to be heir to his father's throne.
The whole English nation was stirred against the
French king for having dared to acknowledge as
their sovereign the boy who had been held to be
supposititious and whose title to the crown had been
rejected by parliament. The citizens of London were
among the first to express their loyalty to William
and their readiness to do their utmost to preserve his
person and government against all invasion. The
king was on the continent at the time, but an address
to this effect, unanimously agreed to by the Common
Council (26 Sept.), was forwarded to him by the
lords justices, who held the reins of government during
his absence, and who in due course were instructed to
inform the City of the great satisfaction its address
had afforded his majesty. The example thus set was
quickly followed by others, and similar addresses
began to flow in from all parts of the kingdom,<a id="noteref_1873" name="noteref_1873" href="#note_1873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1873</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page608">[pg 608]</span><a name="Pg608" id="Pg608" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whilst the City's address was by the king's orders
translated into foreign languages for transmission to
the several courts of Europe.<a id="noteref_1874" name="noteref_1874" href="#note_1874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1874</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few hours before the City's address reached the
hands of the lords justices the citizens had assembled
(29 Sept.) in Common Hall to choose a mayor for
the ensuing year. Sir Charles Duncombe, who had
amassed a large fortune as a goldsmith and banker,
and who, although returned by the livery at the head
of the poll the previous year, had been set aside
by the Court of Aldermen in his contest for the
mayoralty probably on account of his Tory principles,<a id="noteref_1875" name="noteref_1875" href="#note_1875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1875</span></span></a>
was again put up as a candidate, although in point of
seniority he was one of the youngest aldermen. This
time he failed to get a majority of votes at the
Common Hall, but his popularity was still sufficiently
strong to return him second on the poll, and his name
was submitted in conjunction with that of William
Gore to the Court of Aldermen for them to select
one. It was quite within their province to select if
they chose the second name submitted to them—they<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page609">[pg 609]</span><a name="Pg609" id="Pg609" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had frequently done so before—but in the face of
Louis's recent act of insolence they preferred to call
to the mayoralty chair a man whose Tory principles
were not too pronounced rather than one who had
accepted an alderman's commission from James II, and
Sir William Gore was accordingly declared elected.<a id="noteref_1876" name="noteref_1876" href="#note_1876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1876</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The parliament which assembled in February,
1701, enjoyed a still shorter existence than its predecessor,
for it was dissolved in the following
November. Another was summoned to meet in
December.<a id="noteref_1877" name="noteref_1877" href="#note_1877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1877</span></span></a> Great excitement prevailed in the city
over this election. The Whigs met at the Crown
Tavern behind the Exchange and agreed to put up
three of the old members, viz., Clayton, Ashurst and
Heathcote, and to run a fresh candidate in the person
of Sir Thomas Abney. The Tory or "Church party"
opposed these candidates with four others, viz., Sir
William Gore, the lord mayor, Sir John Fleet, Sir
Richard Levett and Sir Charles Duncombe, the recently
defeated candidate for the mayoralty. When it came
to polling all four Whigs were returned by an overwhelming
majority.<a id="noteref_1878" name="noteref_1878" href="#note_1878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1878</span></span></a> This was the last parliament of
William's reign. On the 20th February (1702) he
was thrown from his horse whilst riding in Richmond
Park and broke his collar-bone. His health had
previously shown signs of giving way. On the 8th
March he died.</p>

themselves into "close" mourning, each alderman providing
himself with a mourning gown at his own

provide similar gowns for the chief officers of the

been done on the demise of Charles II.<a id="noteref_1881" name="noteref_1881" href="#note_1881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1881</span></span></a> They further<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page611">[pg 611]</span><a name="Pg611" id="Pg611" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
resolved, with her majesty's permission, to cause her
portrait to be painted and to be set up in the Guildhall
and a statue of her to be set up at the Royal Exchange.
It was found on enquiry that the statues of kings and
queens already in the Royal Exchange had been set
up at the expense of the companies, except those of
William and Mary, which (as we have seen) were
erected by order of the Common Council. On the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the Revolution it had been the custom for
parliament to cease to exist immediately on the demise
of the crown. It was held that inasmuch as the king<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page612">[pg 612]</span><a name="Pg612" id="Pg612" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was the head of the parliament, and as the members

king, but must with the death of the king, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ipso facto</span></span>,
itself expire. The inconveniences arising from this
had at length become so apparent that an Act had

a period of six months after such demise.<a id="noteref_1884" name="noteref_1884" href="#note_1884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1884</span></span></a> By virtue

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The "good" Queen Anne, warmly attached as
she was to the Church of England, was naturally
inclined towards the Tories in preference to the Whigs,
and lost no time in dismissing Somers, Halifax and
other Whig ministers of the late king and filling their
places with Tories. Her action in this respect
influenced the coming elections more especially in the
city of London, where a new commission of lieutenancy
appointed by the queen had already turned out six
colonels of Whiggish proclivities and had put in their
place others of a different political character.<a id="noteref_1885" name="noteref_1885" href="#note_1885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1885</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only one of the old Whig members managed to

of Sir John Moore, deceased, and who may have
inherited some of the Tory principles of his predecessor
together with the aldermanic gown. There is nothing
like office for chastening a man's political opinions.
However this may have been, his three colleagues
elected to serve with him in the coming parliament
were also aldermen of the city and staunch Tories.
These were Sir William Pritchard, Sir John Fleet and
Sir Francis Child. A scrutiny had been demanded by
Clayton, Ashurst and Abney, the defeated candidates,
but it failed to disturb the result of the poll.<a id="noteref_1886" name="noteref_1886" href="#note_1886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1886</span></span></a> Clayton

dinner on lord mayor's day. It was proposed to
invite both Houses of Parliament to the city on that
occasion, but it was found that the accommodation
at the Guildhall was insufficient for the purpose.<a id="noteref_1889" name="noteref_1889" href="#note_1889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1889</span></span></a>
The cost of the entertainment to her majesty was not
thrown on the Chamber, but was discharged by the
aldermen, each of them agreeing to subscribe the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page614">[pg 614]</span><a name="Pg614" id="Pg614" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sum of £25 for the purpose. The entertainment,
however, was given on so lavish a scale that these
contributions had to be doubled, in addition to which
the outgoing as well as the incoming mayor contributed
£300 respectively and each of the sheriffs £150.
The whole cost of the entertainment amounted to
£2,000.<a id="noteref_1890" name="noteref_1890" href="#note_1890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1890</span></span></a> The queen acknowledged the hospitality

Richard Hoare, the goldsmith of Fleet Street, Gilbert
Heathcote, the city member, and upon "Mr. Eaton,"

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scarce a fortnight elapsed before the queen again
visited the city (12 Nov.), the occasion being a public
thanksgiving service in St. Paul's for the successes of
Marlborough, Ormond and Rooke. In July Marlborough
had opened the campaign against France
and Spain, war having been declared against those
countries on the 4th May,<a id="noteref_1892" name="noteref_1892" href="#note_1892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1892</span></span></a> and although he had
been unable to bring the enemy to a general engagement
he had succeeded in reducing several important
towns and in cutting off the communications of the
French with the Lower Rhine. At sea the English
and Dutch combined fleets under the command of
Sir George Rooke, with a large number of troops on
board under the command of the Duke of Ormond,
had succeeded in capturing a rich booty in Vigo Bay.<a id="noteref_1893" name="noteref_1893" href="#note_1893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1893</span></span></a>
Both Houses of Parliament attended the service.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page615">[pg 615]</span><a name="Pg615" id="Pg615" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The order of the procession and the distribution of
seats within the cathedral are given in detail in a
report laid before the Court of Aldermen (15 Dec.).<a id="noteref_1894" name="noteref_1894" href="#note_1894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1894</span></span></a>
The queen, who was attired in purple, and wore her
collar and George, was met at Temple Bar by the
mayor, aldermen and sheriffs on horseback. The
city sword, having been presented to her majesty and
restored to the mayor, was carried by him next before
her majesty's coach to the cathedral. The streets
from St. James' to Temple Bar were lined by the
Westminster militia, and from Temple Bar to Ludgate
by two regiments of the city trained bands. The
balconies and windows were hung with carpets and
tapestry. On arriving at St. Paul's her majesty was
met at the door by the Peers and escorted to the
choir of the cathedral by the Duke of Somerset and
the lord chamberlain, the sword of state being borne
before her by the Duke of Ormond. The spectacle
which presented itself inside St. Paul's on this occasion
has scarcely ever been equalled. Opposite the altar,
on a throne of state, sat the queen. The Peers were
accommodated with seats in the body of the choir,
whilst the Commons sat in the stalls and upper
galleries on either side. In the two lower galleries
next the throne sat the foreign ministers and ladies
"of quality." There were two other galleries near
the altar, one on the north side and the other on the
south side of the church. The latter was occupied by
the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs, whilst the former
was occupied (as usual) by their ladies. The sermon
was preached by the Bishop of Exeter. The night
was given up to bonfires and illuminations.<a id="noteref_1895" name="noteref_1895" href="#note_1895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1895</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two years later the city's minster—now rapidly
approaching completion—was again the scene of a
similar gathering, the occasion being a thanksgiving
service for a signal victory gained by Marlborough
over the French and Bavarian forces at Blenheim,
near Hochstadt in Germany (2 Aug., o.s.).<a id="noteref_1896" name="noteref_1896" href="#note_1896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1896</span></span></a> The

The City in the meanwhile voted (30 Aug.)
an address to her majesty<a id="noteref_1898" name="noteref_1898" href="#note_1898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1898</span></span></a> congratulating her on the
success that had attended her arms and complimenting
her on her judgment in selecting Marlborough for the
command, whose courage and conduct had "settled
the tottering empire, relieved Savoy, chastised the
Elector of Bavaria, and curbed the ambition of the
French king." They prayed that her majesty
might long live a terror to her enemies, a defence to
her injured neighbours and a delight to her subjects.
The next day (31 Aug.) the mayor issued his precept
to the several livery companies to prepare their
rails, stands, banners and other usual "ornaments of
triumph" with the view of taking up such position
in the street as should be assigned to them.<a id="noteref_1899" name="noteref_1899" href="#note_1899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1899</span></span></a> Several
of the companies, viz., the Girdlers, the Scriveners
and the Glovers, refused to obey the precept, and were
thereupon summoned before the Court of Aldermen
to answer for their conduct, whilst others like the
Dyers, the Cooks and the Poulterers were excused.<a id="noteref_1900" name="noteref_1900" href="#note_1900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1900</span></span></a>
A little difficulty arose touching the seats assigned<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page617">[pg 617]</span><a name="Pg617" id="Pg617" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the lord chamberlain in St. Paul's to the civic
dignitaries, who claimed the right to occupy the seats
and places where they usually sat, the more so on
this occasion because, parliament not being then in
session, the members of neither House were to be in
attendance. How matters were eventually arranged
does not appear, but the Court of Aldermen up to the
last moment were emphatic in their resolution that
the lord mayor should insist on keeping his place in
the cathedral, and a week later (14 Sept.) appointed
a committee to search for precedents as to the place
occupied by the mayor and aldermen in processions
and their seats in St. Paul's on occasions of any king
or queen coming there to hear a sermon.<a id="noteref_1901" name="noteref_1901" href="#note_1901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1901</span></span></a> In other

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the morning of the 14th December Marlborough
arrived in London, bringing in his train
Marshal Tallard and other general officers whom he
had made captive at Blenheim. On the 20th an
invitation was sent for his grace to dine with the Court
of Aldermen and the sheriffs at Goldsmiths' Hall,
the residence of Sir Owen Buckingham, the lord
mayor, on any day he might name. The invitation
having been graciously accepted for the 6th
January, the duke was further requested to bring
with him what company he pleased, for his grace
would find none others there besides the lord mayor,
aldermen and sheriffs to entertain him. Each alderman
and sheriff was called upon to subscribe the
sum of £25 towards defraying the cost of the
entertainment.<a id="noteref_1902" name="noteref_1902" href="#note_1902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1902</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day appointed the duke was conveyed
to the city in one of her majesty's own coaches,
accompanied by the Duke of Somerset, the foreign
ministers and a large number of the nobility and
general officers of the army. At Temple Bar he was
met by the city marshal, by whom he was conducted
to Goldsmiths' Hall. There a "noble treat" was
set out for the guests, "the queen's musick playing
all the while, and everything performed in great
splendor."<a id="noteref_1903" name="noteref_1903" href="#note_1903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1903</span></span></a> The Common Council acknowledged

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime, whilst Marlborough had been
so successfully carrying on the work which the late
king had set himself to do, the city of London had
been busy setting its house in order. The poor were
with them in greater numbers than ever. The statute
(13 and 14 Chas. II, c. 12) passed in 1662 for the
better relief of the poor of the kingdom, authorising
the erection of workhouses, necessitated the expenditure
of a great deal of money, and a sum amounting
to nearly £5,000 had to be periodically raised for the
purpose by assessment of the several parishes of the
city.<a id="noteref_1905" name="noteref_1905" href="#note_1905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1905</span></span></a> Besides this there was a yearly sum of £8,000
due by the City to the orphans and its other
creditors, a sum which exceeded the City's yearly
revenue. The consequence was that the City had
become greatly in debt. To remedy this state of affairs
various methods were resorted to. An attempt was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page619">[pg 619]</span><a name="Pg619" id="Pg619" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made at the commencement of the present reign to
get the queen's sanction for compelling every governor,
deputy governor, or committeeman of both the East
India companies to take up the freedom of the City.
The question was referred to the attorney-general,
whose opinion on the matter was duly reported to the
Common Council.<a id="noteref_1906" name="noteref_1906" href="#note_1906"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1906</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 1st July, 1703, another committee was
appointed to examine the state of the Chamber, and
to consider of ways and means for its supply and for
the support of the government of the city. On the
18th August this committee recommended to the
Common Council that an exact survey of all the
City's estate should be made in each ward by the
alderman and his deputy, and that such surveys
should be sent to the town clerk so that they might
be entered in a book. The court approved of the
recommendation, and ordered that it should be carried
out "with all expedition imaginable."<a id="noteref_1907" name="noteref_1907" href="#note_1907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1907</span></span></a> The City's
markets,<a id="noteref_1908" name="noteref_1908" href="#note_1908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1908</span></span></a> the City's beams<a id="noteref_1909" name="noteref_1909" href="#note_1909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1909</span></span></a> and everything else that
could be let on lease were let at improved rentals, and
everything that could be sold was sold. On the 4th
November (1703) the lord mayor (Sir John Parsons)
informed the Common Council that towards the
payment of the City's debts his lordship and the two
sheriffs had agreed to lay before the court certain
papers showing (1) what the several places under
the Corporation would sell for, (2) what the lord
mayor himself and the sheriffs were willing to take
for their share of each place, and (3) what part of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page620">[pg 620]</span><a name="Pg620" id="Pg620" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purchase-money might be devoted to the liquidation
of the City's debts.<a id="noteref_1910" name="noteref_1910" href="#note_1910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1910</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The schedule is an interesting one as showing
the value attached to various offices under the City.
Thus a water-bailiff's place would sell for £2,200, a
sword-bearer's for £2,500, and that of a clerk of the
Chamber for as much as £2,600 (the highest of all),
whilst a City solicitor could purchase his place for
£1,500, and a City remembrancer could do the same
for £1,200. The scheme proposed by the mayor
and sheriffs on this occasion affected no less than
one hundred and sixty-three places of employment,
and was simplicity itself, being nothing more than
that they themselves and their successors should
forego one-third of the value of any place that
became vacant during their year of office, and that
this third should be devoted to payment of the City's
liabilities. The total value of these purchaseable
places amounted to £107,860, one-third of which, viz.,
£35,953 6<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 8<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>, would, if this proposal were carried
out (and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if every place fell vacant within the year</span></em>),
be available for the discharge of the City's debts.
In a second schedule were set out certain other
places filled chiefly by artificers, who, by their
extravagant charges, had contributed (it was said) in
no small degree to the City's indebtedness. These
were to be excluded from the scheme, much to their
disappointment. When any one of them died,
surrendered his place or was dismissed from it for
just cause, his place was not to be filled up, and the
payment of 10<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> a week, more or less, which such<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page621">[pg 621]</span><a name="Pg621" id="Pg621" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
artificer had been in the habit of receiving from the
City, "work or not work," was to cease.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proposals thus laid before the Common
Council met with the approval of the court, and the
committee was instructed to embody them in a Bill.
A Bill was accordingly drawn up and read the first
time on the 4th February, 1704. It passed on the
24th,<a id="noteref_1911" name="noteref_1911" href="#note_1911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1911</span></span></a> and the thanks of the Common Council were
returned to the mayor and sheriffs for their generous
offers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March, 1705, Marlborough sailed for Holland
to resume the campaign. By July he had succeeded
in forcing the French lines which stretched across the
country from Namur to Antwerp. For this success
another thanksgiving service was held at St. Paul's,
and attended by the queen in person (23 Aug.).<a id="noteref_1912" name="noteref_1912" href="#note_1912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1912</span></span></a>
Had the general been allowed a free hand by his
Dutch allies a decisive battle might have been fought.
The Dutch officers refused, however, to co-operate in
an attack, and Marlborough had to give way with the
best grace he could.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During Marlborough's absence the parliament of
1702, which would soon have terminated by efflux of
time under the provisions of the Triennial Act, had
been dissolved (5 April) and a new one summoned.
Once more the political pendulum swung back and a
Whig parliament was returned. The Tories rather
injured than aided their cause by raising the cry that
the Church was in danger, whilst the Whig party was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page622">[pg 622]</span><a name="Pg622" id="Pg622" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
daily increasing in favour not only with the queen,
who highly resented such a cry, but also with
Marlborough and Godolphin. In the city both
parties put up four candidates, but when the poll was
declared it was found that all four Whigs had been
returned by an overwhelming majority.<a id="noteref_1913" name="noteref_1913" href="#note_1913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1913</span></span></a> One of
the results of an understanding arrived at between
Marlborough and the Tory leaders with the Whig
Junto was a modification of an article in the Act
of Settlement, which, after the accession of the
House of Hanover, would have otherwise debarred
ministers and other placemen from the House of
Commons. A compromise was effected whereby
only those who enjoyed a pension or office created
after the 25th October, 1705, were to be disqualified
from sitting in the House, whilst all other offices
were declared compatible with a seat if the holder
presented himself to his constituents for re-election
at the time of his appointment.<a id="noteref_1914" name="noteref_1914" href="#note_1914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1914</span></span></a> This arrangement
is still in force, although the necessity of it has long

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a brief stay in England, where he had
arrived at the opening of the new year (1706),
Marlborough again crossed over to Holland before the
spring. A few weeks only elapsed before he gained
fresh laurels by another signal defeat of the French<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page623">[pg 623]</span><a name="Pg623" id="Pg623" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at the little village of Ramillies (12 May, o.s.).<a id="noteref_1915" name="noteref_1915" href="#note_1915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1915</span></span></a> On

so closely on one another the Court of Aldermen
resolved that the new crimson velvet gown with
which the lord mayor was furnished on these occasions
at the City's expense should no longer be appropriated
by him, but should be carefully laid up by the hall
keeper for future use.<a id="noteref_1918" name="noteref_1918" href="#note_1918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1918</span></span></a> At the humble request of the
lord mayor (Sir Thomas Rawlinson) her majesty
graciously consented to bestow the trophies and
colours recently taken in Flanders upon the City to
the intent that they might be hung up in the Guildhall.
It was not, however, until the 19th December,
when the Duke of Marlborough was sumptuously
entertained at Vintners' Hall, that twenty-six standards
and sixty-three colours, taken at Ramillies,
were brought into the city in great state, there to be
displayed on the walls of the Guildhall.<a id="noteref_1919" name="noteref_1919" href="#note_1919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1919</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These successes were not achieved without great
expenditure of blood and money. At the close of
the previous year (1705) the lord mayor had received
an order under the royal sign manual requiring him
and the Court of Aldermen to forthwith impress 1,000<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page624">[pg 624]</span><a name="Pg624" id="Pg624" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men—such as had no visible means of subsistence—for

March (1706) it was found necessary to open a
subscription at Mercers' Chapel for furnishing Prince
Eugene with £250,000 to assist him in carrying on
the campaign in Italy. Notwithstanding the depressed
state of the Corporation finances, the city abounded
in wealth, and by the close of the first day no less
than £160,000 of the whole loan had been underwritten,
Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Sir William Scawen,
Sir James Bateman and Sir Henry Furnese making
themselves each responsible for the sum of £4,000.<a id="noteref_1921" name="noteref_1921" href="#note_1921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1921</span></span></a>
With the pecuniary assistance thus afforded him, and
with the reinforcements which Marlborough despatched
to him from Holland, the prince was enabled
to raise the siege of Turin (7 Sept., 1706).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not long before the crimson velvet gown
was again brought into requisition. So great success
had attended the allied armies in 1706 that the queen
ordered another day of public thanksgiving to be
kept on the last day of the year, when she paid
another solemn visit to St. Paul's, accompanied by
both Houses of Parliament. Strange to say the
records of the Court of Aldermen are absolutely
silent as to the preparations made for the occasion,
but from another source we know them to have been
on the same scale as formerly, and we may depend
upon it that the crimson velvet gown was there.<a id="noteref_1922" name="noteref_1922" href="#note_1922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1922</span></span></a></p>

the immense risk which the merchant and trader ran
in pursuing his regular vocation when one reads that
on the 10th July (1706) a cart with iron-bound
wheels and laden with twenty-five barrels of gunpowder
had been overturned on Fish Street Hill and
the gunpowder scattered. Nor was this the only
accident that had occurred; the wonder is that the
entire city had not been blown up long since, seeing
that gunpowder was a commodity dealt in by grocers!
The Common Council took the matter up and made
a representation to the queen.<a id="noteref_1923" name="noteref_1923" href="#note_1923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1923</span></span></a> Next year a Bill was
introduced into the House of Commons by Sir Gilbert
Heathcote and Samuel Shepheard, two of the city members,
for preventing the dangers arising from bringing
or laying up quantities of gunpowder within the city
and liberties, but before the Lords and Commons
could come to an agreement parliament was prorogued
(24 April, 1707).<a id="noteref_1924" name="noteref_1924" href="#note_1924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1924</span></span></a> The municipal authorities were
not content to let matters rest here, but prepared a
petition to parliament for leave to bring in another
Bill. The petition was ordered to lie on the table
(24 Feb., 1708),<a id="noteref_1925" name="noteref_1925" href="#note_1925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1925</span></span></a> and in the meantime the citizens
had to be satisfied with an undertaking already given
by powder-makers not to carry any gunpowder to
any wharf or stairs within half a mile of London
Bridge.<a id="noteref_1926" name="noteref_1926" href="#note_1926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1926</span></span></a></p>

ratified by both the English and Scottish parliaments
and received the formal assent of the Crown, a day of
public thanksgiving (1 May, 1707) was ordered to be
observed for the happy conclusion of the treaty
between the two kingdoms. A proclamation had
previously been issued (29 April) constituting the
existing Houses of Lords and Commons the first
parliament of Great Britain for and on the part of
England, whilst sixteen peers and forty-five commoners
were to be elected to represent Scotland
in the same parliament. The first meeting was
to take place at Westminster on the 23rd October.<a id="noteref_1927" name="noteref_1927" href="#note_1927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1927</span></span></a>
Meanwhile addresses of congratulation to the queen
arrived from various parts of the kingdom; but in
consequence of the Article of Union declaring the
Presbyterian form to be the true Protestant religion,
no such address came from the University of Oxford.
It was otherwise with the city of London, where
Presbyterianism had always been in favour. On the
9th May the Common Council voted an address to
her majesty congratulating her upon the happy
union of the two kingdoms, a blessing which Heaven
(they declared) had reserved for her to accomplish,

Queen Anne, and lost no opportunity of showing their
loyalty. Such an opportunity presented itself in the
spring of the following year (1708), when Scotland
was threatened by a French invasion in favour of the
Pretender. The citizens hastened to assure her that<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page627">[pg 627]</span><a name="Pg627" id="Pg627" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the French preparations inspired them—her majesty's
most dutiful and loyal subjects—with no terror.
The repeated tenders of their lives and fortunes were
(she was asked to believe) not empty words, but they

the oath of abjuration was to be administered to all

by the growing strength of the Tory party in the city,

On that day he was attacked with dropsy and

Villars, the French marshal, entrenched himself at

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before another campaign was opened the ascendancy
of the Whigs had passed away. They had
rendered themselves the more obnoxious to the
citizens by the passing of an Act for the naturalization
of foreign Protestants,<a id="noteref_1946" name="noteref_1946" href="#note_1946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1946</span></span></a> the result of which had been
to overcrowd the city with needy foreigners at a time
when there was a great scarcity of provisions. A cry
was raised that the price of corn and bread was being
enhanced by the action of forestallers, and the lord
mayor was instructed by letter from Sunderland
(3 Oct., 1709) to put the law in force against all
engrossers, forestallers and regraters of corn. The
mayor in reply assured the secretary of state that
there were no such engrossers in the city, but that the
present dearness was caused by the exportation of
large quantities of corn and grain to foreign countries.
The city authorities had, moreover, been informed
that wheat was selling in the north of England at 40<span class="tei tei-abbr"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span>
a quarter and less. They therefore suggested that
government should furnish a sufficient convoy for the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bitter feeling against the Whigs engendered
by their overbearing and dictatorial conduct whenever
in power was increased by a sermon preached at
St. Paul's on the 5th November before the lord mayor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page632">[pg 632]</span><a name="Pg632" id="Pg632" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and aldermen by Dr. Sacheverell, a high church Tory.
Taking for his text the words of the Apostle, "In
perils among false brethren" (2 Cor., xi, 26), the
preacher advocated in its entirety the doctrine of non-resistance,
condemned every sort of toleration, and
attacked with much bitterness the Dissenters. Sir
Samuel Garrard, who had but recently entered on his
duties as lord mayor (having been elected in place of
Sir Jeffery Jeffreys, who had been excused from office
on the ground of ill-health),<a id="noteref_1950" name="noteref_1950" href="#note_1950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1950</span></span></a> was himself also a high
Tory, and as such was greatly pleased with the sentiments
put forth by Sacheverell. He congratulated the
preacher on his sermon, and is said to have expressed a
hope that it would be printed. If so, it would appear
to betoken some doubt in his mind as to his brother
aldermen consenting to print such a polemical discourse.
As a rule all sermons preached on state
occasions before the mayor and aldermen were ordered
by the court to be printed as a matter of course, the
sum of forty shillings being voted towards the expense.
Two sermons recently preached before them, one at
St. Paul's and the other in the church of St. Lawrence
Jewry, were so ordered (8 Nov.) to be printed by the
court; but when on the same day the question was
put to them that Dr. Sacheverell should be desired to
print his sermon it was negatived.<a id="noteref_1951" name="noteref_1951" href="#note_1951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1951</span></span></a> Sacheverell took
no notice of this rebuff, but printed the sermon on
his own responsibility and at his own expense, with
a prefatory dedication to the mayor.<a id="noteref_1952" name="noteref_1952" href="#note_1952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1952</span></span></a> The sermon
was immensely popular with the high church party,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page633">[pg 633]</span><a name="Pg633" id="Pg633" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a large number of copies were circulated, much
to the disgust of the Whigs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the ministry resolved to take proceedings
against the author. On the 13th December
a complaint was made to the House of Commons of
this sermon, as well as of another sermon of similar
character which had been preached by Sacheverell
before the judges at the last summer assizes at Derby.
After some debate the House resolved that both these
sermons were "malicious, scandalous and seditious
libels highly reflecting upon her majesty and her
government, the late happy revolution, and the
Protestant succession as by law established," and
ordered that Dr. Henry Sacheverell and Henry
Clements, his publisher, should attend at the Bar of
the House the next day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly the next day (14 Dec.) the doctor
and the bookseller appeared. Sacheverell owned that
he was the author of the two discourses, and gave an
account of what had taken place between himself and
the lord mayor; but whilst expressing his regret at
having incurred the displeasure of the House, he
showed no contrition for the doctrines he had promulgated.
The lord mayor, who was present in the
House in his capacity as member for Agmondesham,
was thereupon asked if he had given any orders for
causing the sermon preached at St. Paul's to be printed,
but he denied having done so.<a id="noteref_1953" name="noteref_1953" href="#note_1953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1953</span></span></a> The doctor being
called upon to retire, the House resolved to impeach
him of high crimes and misdemeanours and in the
meantime committed him to the custody of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page634">[pg 634]</span><a name="Pg634" id="Pg634" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sergeant-at-arms. Application was made a few days
later for bail to be allowed, but this the House refused.<a id="noteref_1954" name="noteref_1954" href="#note_1954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1954</span></span></a>
It was, however, subsequently granted by the Lords,
but at a very high amount, viz., Sacheverell himself
in £6,000 and two sureties in £3,000 respectively.
One of these sureties was no other than the Vice-Chancellor
of Oxford University, of which Sacheverell
was a member.<a id="noteref_1955" name="noteref_1955" href="#note_1955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1955</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was originally intended that the trial should
take place at the Bar of the House of Lords, but as
the Commons insisted upon being present as a committee
of the whole House, the Lords appointed
Westminster Hall to be the place of trial and instructed
Sir Christopher Wren to make the necessary preparations
as speedily as possible.<a id="noteref_1956" name="noteref_1956" href="#note_1956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1956</span></span></a> The trial commenced
on the 27th February and continued for three weeks.
Day after day as Sacheverell passed from his lodgings
in the Temple to Westminster Hall and home again
his coach was besieged by crowds striving to kiss
his hand and shouting "Sacheverell and the Church
for ever!" So again when the queen, impelled by
curiosity, attended the trial, as she did on more than
one occasion, shouts were raised as she passed on
her way of "God bless your majesty and the Church!
we hope your majesty is for Dr. Sacheverell!"
Had the mob confined itself to this kind of demonstration
little harm had been done. Unfortunately
it allowed itself to be carried away by excitement
and took to attacking meeting-houses and damaging<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page635">[pg 635]</span><a name="Pg635" id="Pg635" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

sides having at last been concluded, the Lords, by a
narrow majority, pronounced Sacheverell guilty. They
did not venture, however, to proceed against him
with any greater severity than to order his sermons
to be burnt at the Exchange by the common hangman,
in the presence of the lord mayor and sheriffs, and to
prohibit him from preaching for the next three years.<a id="noteref_1958" name="noteref_1958" href="#note_1958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1958</span></span></a>
Such a sentence was virtually a victory for the Tories
and a defeat of the Whigs. Lord mayor Garrard
contrived to escape the humiliation of presiding over
the burning of a sermon of which he in his heart
approved, and this part of the sentence was carried out
in his absence under the supervision of the sheriffs.<a id="noteref_1959" name="noteref_1959" href="#note_1959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1959</span></span></a>
The verdict was welcomed in the city with illuminations
and bonfires, accompanied with some little
tumult and disorder. The queen complained to the
Court of Aldermen by letter, and thereupon the court
appointed a committee to investigate the recent riots
(27 March, 1710). The result was that the ringleaders
were arrested and bound over to the sessions.<a id="noteref_1960" name="noteref_1960" href="#note_1960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1960</span></span></a>
The streets were flooded with republican pamphlets
which the House ordered to be burnt by the
common hangman.<a id="noteref_1961" name="noteref_1961" href="#note_1961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1961</span></span></a> Addresses were sent in from
all parts of the country, some in favour of the

her majesty was assured of the City's hatred of all
"anti-monarchical principles," its continued loyalty
to her person and government, its zeal for the Church
of England, its tender regard for liberty of conscience
and its resolution to maintain the Protestant succession.
The address concluded by saying that in obedience
to her majesty's commands the civic authorities would
do their utmost care to prevent and suppress riotous
assemblies.<a id="noteref_1963" name="noteref_1963" href="#note_1963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1963</span></span></a> The address, together with one from the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The queen seized the opportunity afforded her
by this outburst of Tory enthusiasm to get rid of the
Whig ministry. For some time past she had been
anxious to free herself from Marlborough and the
domineering influence of his wife. During the trial of
Sacheverell Marlborough had been on the continent.
In view of the approaching struggle between Whigs
and Tories, both parties preferred to be relieved of
his presence. To this end Sir Gilbert Heathcote,
one of the Whig members for the city, had moved
an address to her majesty (16 Feb.) praying she
would order the duke to Holland, "where his
presence will be equally necessary to assist at the
negotiations of peace and to hasten the preparations
for an early campaign."<a id="noteref_1965" name="noteref_1965" href="#note_1965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1965</span></span></a> The address, having
received the unanimous assent of both Houses, was
graciously received by the queen, and Marlborough
had set out. In his absence the queen proceeded
cautiously to effect her object. One by one the
Whigs were removed from office and their places<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page637">[pg 637]</span><a name="Pg637" id="Pg637" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
filled up by Tories. Sunderland was the first to go,
the seals being transferred to Lord Dartmouth. It
was feared in commercial circles that his dismissal
betokened a general change of ministry and that a
panic would follow. The queen, however, assured
Sir Gilbert Heathcote, at that time governor of the
Bank of England, that she had no immediate
intention of making further changes, but that if any
were made she would take care that they should not
be prejudicial to the bank or to the common cause.<a id="noteref_1966" name="noteref_1966" href="#note_1966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1966</span></span></a>
Notwithstanding the assurances thus given, less than
two months elapsed before Godolphin was made to
follow Sunderland. After this many of the Whig
ministers resigned, whilst others waited to be turned
out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few weeks after the dismissal of Godolphin
the queen insisted on dissolving parliament, and writs
were issued (27 Sept.) for a new House to meet in
November.<a id="noteref_1967" name="noteref_1967" href="#note_1967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1967</span></span></a> Harley, who was the queen's chief
adviser, having failed in an attempt to form a coalition
of Tories and moderate Whigs, placed all his hopes
in the result of a general election. Every effort was
made to get a Tory majority returned, and with
success. Bishop Burnet, whose Whiggish proclivities
are apparent in every page of his history, took no
pains to disguise his opinions as to the way the
elections were generally carried out, and more particularly
in the city of London. "While the poll was
taken in London," he writes,<a id="noteref_1968" name="noteref_1968" href="#note_1968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1968</span></span></a> "a new commission
for the lieutenancy of the city was sent in, by which
a great change was made; Tories were put in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page638">[pg 638]</span><a name="Pg638" id="Pg638" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Whigs were left out; in a word, the practice
and violence now used in elections went far beyond
anything that I have ever known in England." If
freedom of election was to count for anything, the
worthy bishop entertained grave doubts as to the new
parliament being a representative parliament at all.
Only one of the old members was returned by the
city, viz., Sir William Withers. With him were
elected another alderman of the city, viz., Sir Richard
Hoare, who had been defeated in the Tory interest at
the last election, Sir George Newland and John Cass,<a id="noteref_1969" name="noteref_1969" href="#note_1969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1969</span></span></a>
who afterwards became an alderman, and who, at his
decease, left money for the foundation of a school in
the parish of St. Botoph, Aldgate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The new House of Commons being strongly Tory,
Harley and St. John found themselves compelled to
form a purely Tory ministry. On the 27th the queen
delivered a speech in person, reflecting, as was
supposed, the policy of the new ministry. To
carry on the war with the utmost vigour was, she
declared, the surest way of procuring a safe and
honourable peace for England and her allies, and
in February of the following year (1711) Marlborough
was despatched for the avowed purpose of
carrying this policy into execution, the Commons
being called upon to furnish supplies. Yet in the
midst of all this Harley commenced opening secret
negotiations for a peace with France, regardless of
the interests of England's allies. By September
(1711) these negotiations had so far progressed that
preliminaries for a peace were actually signed, but<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page639">[pg 639]</span><a name="Pg639" id="Pg639" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for fear lest the favourable terms obtained for England
should provoke the jealousy of the Dutch a garbled
edition of the treaty was specially prepared for the
edification of our allies. Such was the political
morality of the age!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The High Church party being in power, the
queen took the opportunity of enlisting their support
for a project she had much at heart. For some time
past the want of new churches in the fast increasing
suburbs of London had engaged the attention of convocation,
by whom the matter had been represented to
the queen. Her majesty now commended "so good
and pious a work" to the attention of the Commons, a
commendation which received additional force from
the presentation of petitions from ministers of various
parishes in and around London for assistance in carrying
out repairs. The Commons showed considerable
zeal in the matter, declaring, in their reply to her
majesty's address, that neither the long expensive war
in which they were engaged nor the pressure of heavy
debts should hinder them from granting whatever
was necessary.<a id="noteref_1970" name="noteref_1970" href="#note_1970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1970</span></span></a> A Bill was accordingly brought in
(18 May) for the purpose of building fifty new
churches, computing 4,750 souls to each church, as
well as for providing annual sums of money to be
expended on the completion of Westminster Abbey
and Greenwich Hospital. The cost was to be defrayed
by a further duty on coal. By the 28th May the Bill
passed the Commons.<a id="noteref_1971" name="noteref_1971" href="#note_1971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1971</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In June (1711) parliament was prorogued and

was then effected which reflected little credit upon
either of the political parties, but secured the passing
of the Occasional Conformity Bill, a Bill on which the
queen and the high Tories had set their hearts, but
which had already been defeated twice by the Lords.
The object of the Bill was to inflict penalties upon
those Dissenters who, having qualified themselves to
sit as common councilmen or as officers in corporations
or elsewhere by receiving the Sacrament, afterwards
betook themselves to places of worship where the
Book of Common Prayer was not used, and where
neither the queen nor the Princess Sophia were
prayed for.<a id="noteref_1972" name="noteref_1972" href="#note_1972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1972</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In September (1711) party spirit ran high in the
city, the occasion being the election of an alderman
for the ward of Broad Street in the place of Sir Joseph
Woolfe, deceased. No less than four candidates were
nominated by each side, two out of each four being
already aldermen. The Tory or Church party were
represented by Sir William Withers and William
Lewen, aldermen, Sir George Newland and Sir
Robert Dunkley, commoners. The Whigs or Dissenters
advocated Sir John Houblon and Sir Samuel
Stanier, aldermen, Sir John Scott and Gerrard Conyers,
commoners. The wardmote was held at Drapers'
Hall, and was presided over by Sir Gilbert Heathcote,
the mayor, a strong Whig. It appears from a
newspaper of the day<a id="noteref_1973" name="noteref_1973" href="#note_1973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1973</span></span></a> that although the mayor
caused the Act of Common Council, setting forth the
qualifications of persons who had a right to vote on<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page641">[pg 641]</span><a name="Pg641" id="Pg641" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the occasion, to be read at the wardmote, he refused
to make proclamation that those who were not
qualified should depart from the hall. The result was
that a large number of foreigners and other unqualified
persons voted. The lord mayor having declared the
show of hands to be in favour of the four Whig
candidates, a poll was demanded, which reversed the
mayor's decision. A scrutiny was next asked for and
allowed, but the mayor steadily refused to express
any opinion as to who of the voters were qualified and
who were disqualified without first consulting counsel.
The result of the scrutiny was declared (27 Oct.) by
the mayor to be in favour of all four Whig candidates,
and on the following day he made a report to
that effect to the Court of Aldermen, who thereupon
elected Gerrard Conyers alderman of the ward. The
mayor's decision, however, was challenged, and a
motion was made in the Queen's Bench for setting it
aside as being manifestly wrong and not in accordance
with the number of lawful votes. After Heathcote's
year of office had expired the assistance of the
Common Council was invoked in support of the rights
of electors against such arbitrary proceedings as had
recently taken place. The court agreed to the
necessary legal expenses being defrayed by the
Chamber.<a id="noteref_1974" name="noteref_1974" href="#note_1974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1974</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practice of nominating as many as four candidates
for a vacant aldermanry had prevailed since
the commencement of the 15th century,<a id="noteref_1975" name="noteref_1975" href="#note_1975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1975</span></span></a> but the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page642">[pg 642]</span><a name="Pg642" id="Pg642" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inconvenience arising from this practice became so
manifest during this last election that the Common
Council passed an Act before the result of the election
had been declared, abolishing the custom and enacting
that henceforth only two candidates should be put in
nomination, one an alderman and the other a commoner.<a id="noteref_1976" name="noteref_1976" href="#note_1976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1976</span></span></a>
Even this number was found too many, and
within three years was reduced to one commoner,<a id="noteref_1977" name="noteref_1977" href="#note_1977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1977</span></span></a>
thus reverting to the primitive custom of the city
before it was enacted, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">temp.</span></span> Richard II, that two
(commoners) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least</span></em> should be nominated for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In July, 1712, another dispute arose over the
election of an alderman. Sir John Fleet, alderman of
the ward of Langbourn, had recently died, and it was
necessary to appoint a successor. Four candidates
were put up for the post, of whom two were to be
selected for nomination to the Court of Aldermen
according to the provisions of the recent Act. The
wardmote was opened on the 9th July at Pewterers'
Hall. Sir Robert Beachcroft, the lord mayor, was
himself one of the candidates, the other three being
Sir William Withers, alderman, Sir Samuel Clarke and
Peter Delmé, commoners. The show of hands being
declared to be in favour of Withers and Clarke, two
Tories, a poll was demanded on behalf of his lordship
and Delmé. The result, however, was the same, and
a scrutiny followed. To the great surprise of a large<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page643">[pg 643]</span><a name="Pg643" id="Pg643" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
body of the electors, the mayor eventually declared
(22 Aug.) the majority of votes to be in favour of
himself and Delmé, but like his predecessor he steadily
refused to give any explanation as to how he had
arrived at that conclusion. Again there appeared to
be no remedy but to apply to the Queen's Bench.
The Common Council was again appealed to (6 Sept.),
but whilst the matter was in course of debate the lord
mayor was suddenly taken ill, and the court had to
break up before coming to any resolution on the
matter. On the 12th November, however, the council
agreed to assist the petitioners as before, but refused
any assistance to Delmé, who had already been
admitted alderman, and was about to be put on his
defence.<a id="noteref_1979" name="noteref_1979" href="#note_1979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1979</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1713 the relations between the Courts of
Aldermen and Common Council became still more
strained. The latter complained of the city's business
being hindered from insufficient Courts of Aldermen,
and of a newly elected alderman not having been
sworn in on a certain day by reason of there not being
a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quorum</span></span> of aldermen present. On the 15th May a
joint committee of aldermen and commoners was
appointed to enquire into the matter. Six weeks
elapsed before the committee was ready with its
report. At length, on the 30th June, the committee
certified<a id="noteref_1980" name="noteref_1980" href="#note_1980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1980</span></span></a> that having examined the minute books of
the Court of Aldermen it had found that between
the 24th March and the 15th May last six courts had
been summoned to meet, but for want of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quorum</span></span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page644">[pg 644]</span><a name="Pg644" id="Pg644" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only one full court had been held. On the other
occasions only seven, eight, nine, ten or twelve
aldermen appeared, inclusive of the mayor. The committee
also found that the courts were in the habit of
meeting between twelve and one o'clock, and reported
its opinion that such a late hour for meeting was prejudicial
to the citizens and others who had business there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Touching the other matter which had been
referred to them, the committee found that on the
7th May the lord mayor had reported to the Court of
Aldermen the nomination and election of Sir William
Withers, alderman, and Joseph Lawrence to succeed
Sir Owen Buckingham in the aldermanry of the ward
of Bishopsgate; that Withers declining to remove, had
moved that Lawrence should be called in and sworn,
according to the provisions of the Act of 1711 for
regulating the elections of aldermen; that thereupon a
petition was offered and part of the Act was read;
that after some debate Lawrence was sent for and
came into court; that upon the Common Sergeant
being called in to give his opinion seven of the
aldermen withdrew from the court, but one of them
presently returned, and after hearing the Common
Sergeant deliver his opinion—viz., that notwithstanding
any petition the court was bound by the Act to admit
and swear in Lawrence—again withdrew, notwithstanding
the lord mayor's expressed desire that he
should remain; that by this means a full court was
not kept (only eleven aldermen being left with the
mayor), and so Lawrence, although present, could not
be sworn.<a id="noteref_1981" name="noteref_1981" href="#note_1981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1981</span></span></a> The committee's report was ordered to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page645">[pg 645]</span><a name="Pg645" id="Pg645" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the queen had been persuaded
to dismiss Marlborough on his return to England
(Nov., 1711) from all his offices, and to place the
Duke of Ormond, a strong Tory, in command of the
English forces in the Netherlands. Negotiations with
France were simultaneously pushed on, in spite of a
personal visit which Eugene himself paid to London
(Jan., 1712) in the hope of obtaining a continuance of
English support for carrying on the war. The presence
of the illustrious prince was heartily welcomed by the
Whigs, by whom he was hospitably entertained.
On the 15th January a motion was made in the Court
of Aldermen and carried to the effect that the court
was prepared to join with as many leading citizens
(not exceeding sixty in number) as should be willing in
providing an entertainment by private subscription for
his highness, provided they first obtained her majesty's
permission. Two aldermen were thereupon nominated
to wait upon Lord Dartmouth, principal secretary of
state, in order to learn her majesty's pleasure. There
was nothing unusual in this proceeding. Nevertheless
the idea of the prince being publicly entertained in the
city was so distasteful to the queen and her government
that she found fault with the citizens for daring
to approach her with a mere verbal message (she was
suffering from gout at the time),<a id="noteref_1982" name="noteref_1982" href="#note_1982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1982</span></span></a> and declined to return
an answer to any message which was not brought to
her "with the same respect as has always been paid<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page646">[pg 646]</span><a name="Pg646" id="Pg646" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the city of London to her predecessors."<a id="noteref_1983" name="noteref_1983" href="#note_1983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1983</span></span></a> That
there might be no mistake about the matter the queen's
answer was sent to the City in writing by Lord Dartmouth.
The Court of Aldermen at once appointed a
committee to search the City's Records for the purpose
of ascertaining how and in what manner messages had
been delivered from the court to her majesty and her
predecessors, whether they had usually been in writing
or only verbal. On the 5th February the committee
reported that they found that such messages had been
delivered in a variety of ways: sometimes by the lord
mayor alone, sometimes by two or three aldermen,
and at other times by the recorder and sheriffs only.
One instance had been found of a message having
been sent by a single sheriff. Not once did they
find that a message had been delivered in writing.<a id="noteref_1984" name="noteref_1984" href="#note_1984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1984</span></span></a>
It need scarcely be said that under the circumstances
all idea of the entertainment was dropt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of the prince's high character the greatest
calumnies were whispered against him behind his back.
He was said to be conspiring with Marlborough and the
Whigs to raise an insurrection in the streets, fire the city
and seize the person of the queen. A general panic
prevailed. Even the roysterings of a few drunken revellers
calling themselves "Mohocks"<a id="noteref_1985" name="noteref_1985" href="#note_1985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1985</span></span></a>—the successors of
the "Roreres" and "Riffleres" of a past age—were

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the 6th June negotiations with France had so
far advanced that the queen went down to the House
of Lords to fulfil, as she said, her promise of communicating
to her parliament the terms of peace before it
was absolutely concluded. What pleased the citizens
most in her elaborate speech was the announcement
of the steps taken to secure the Protestant succession
to the House of Hanover and for protecting British
commerce. For these measures they returned to her
majesty their hearty thanks, and expressed their sincere
hopes that she might speedily finish the good work
which had advanced so far notwithstanding "the artful
contrivances and envious efforts of a factious and
malicious party."<a id="noteref_1987" name="noteref_1987" href="#note_1987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1987</span></span></a> In August a proclamation was

March, 1713, the Peace of Utrecht was signed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A fortnight later (14 April, 1713) the Common
Council voted a congratulatory address to her majesty
on the conclusion of the peace with France, but no
copy of the address was to be shown to anyone until
it had been actually presented.<a id="noteref_1989" name="noteref_1989" href="#note_1989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1989</span></span></a> On the 5th May the
lord mayor and Court of Aldermen attended at Temple
Bar to assist at the proclamation, whilst Tuesday the
6th July was observed as a day of public thanksgiving
at St. Paul's. The queen did not attend the service
owing probably to indisposition, and the livery companies
were on that account excused attendance.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page648">[pg 648]</span><a name="Pg648" id="Pg648" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The mayor and aldermen displayed no little anxiety

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shortly before the conclusion of the peace the
term of Sacheverell's suspension expired. His popularity
became greater than ever. The queen presented
him with the living of St. Andrew's, Holborn, whilst
the House of Commons, which had formerly condemned
him, now invited him to preach before them.<a id="noteref_1991" name="noteref_1991" href="#note_1991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1991</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The days of Queen Anne were now fast drawing
to a close. For some time past her health had been
failing, and at the close of the year (1713) she was
confined to her bed at Windsor. Upon notice of her
indisposition being conveyed to the Court of Aldermen
they at once instructed the sheriffs and the city
remembrancer to proceed to Windsor and enquire
after her majesty's health.<a id="noteref_1992" name="noteref_1992" href="#note_1992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1992</span></span></a> The fact that in the
event of the queen's death the legal heir, the
Electress Sophia, and her son, the Elector of Hanover,
were favourable to the Whig party, drove the Tories
to make overtures to the Pretender, the queen's
brother, who was still living in France, although by
the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht Louis had
promised to abandon his cause. On the 1st February
(1714) the queen wrote to the lord mayor<a id="noteref_1993" name="noteref_1993" href="#note_1993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1993</span></span></a> (Sir Samuel
Stanier) informing him that she was recovering her
health and hoped soon to return to her "usual
residence." She further informed his lordship of her<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page649">[pg 649]</span><a name="Pg649" id="Pg649" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
determination to open her parliament on the 16th,
according to the notice given by proclamation, and
desired him to communicate the same to the Court of
Aldermen and to her other loving subjects of the city.
Again the sheriffs and remembrancer were instructed
to go to Windsor and tender the court's acknowledgments
of her majesty's favour and to assure her that
they would discountenance to the utmost of their
power and put a stop to "those malicious rumours
which had been so industriously spread by evil
disposed persons to the prejudice of credit and the
imminent hazard of public peace and tranquility."<a id="noteref_1994" name="noteref_1994" href="#note_1994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1994</span></span></a>
Saturday the 6th was the queen's birthday, and extra
precautions were taken in the city to prevent tumult
or disorder.<a id="noteref_1995" name="noteref_1995" href="#note_1995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1995</span></span></a> A week later her majesty had so far

to greet her with a congratulatory address.<a id="noteref_1996" name="noteref_1996" href="#note_1996"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1996</span></span></a></p>

to thank her majesty for passing an Act entitled "An

queen was seized with her last illness. Notification
was immediately despatched to the lord mayor, who
reported the news to a special Court of Aldermen
that afternoon. The Secretary of State, who had
written to the mayor, had desired his lordship to take
immediate steps to preserve quiet in the city. The
court, on being informed of the turn of affairs,
despatched the sheriffs, the common cryer and the
water bailiff to Kensington to enquire after the
queen's health and to assure her majesty that every
possible care would be taken to preserve the peace
of the city in any event.<a id="noteref_1999" name="noteref_1999" href="#note_1999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1999</span></span></a> Two days later (1 Aug.)

if the City sent that number of burgesses to any other. As to the
parliament of 1654, the names of five members only have come down
to us (see Loftie's "History of London," Appendix B). But
that the city did send six members to this parliament is the more
probable from the fact that in June, 1657, the Common Council prepared
a petition to parliament praying to be allowed to send "their full
number" of six burgesses "already chosen" to parliament.—Journal
41, fo. 156. Moreover, the fact that in March, 1653, the Common
Council ordered a petition to be prepared for parliament "touching the
number of future burgesses for this city in parliament," points to some
probable alteration in the number of city members.—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Id.</span></span>, 41, fo. 83.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_1082" name="note_1082" href="#noteref_1082">1082.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Journal House of Commons, vii, 496.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_1083" name="note_1083" href="#noteref_1083">1083.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sec.

According to the evidence of the
State Papers the king appears to have suggested Bolton's appointment
as surveyor-general by letters to the Common Council, dated the 31st
May and the 5th June, 1667 (Cal. State Papers Dom., 1667, pp. 133,
151). It does not, however, appear to have been considered by the
Common Council until the 14th Sept. There may have been good
reason for the City declining to place the mayor in such a responsible
position of trust, for a few weeks later (3 Dec.) he was suspected of
misappropriating money subscribed to assist the poor of the city, and
pending enquiry was forbidden to attend the Court of Aldermen or
any public function (Repertory 73, fos. 28b, 61, 93b, 95, 95b, 107b).
After bringing a charge against the Bishop of London in September,
1668, of misappropriating the sum of £50, and afterwards withdrawing,
he was himself convicted in 1675 of having embezzled large sums of
money intended for the poor (Repertory 73, fos. 260b, 264, 292b, 303;
Repertory 80, fo. 119b). Reduced to poverty, he was granted by the
City an allowance of £3 a week, which after his decease was continued
to his widow (Journal 49, fo. 100b).</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_1356" name="note_1356" href="#noteref_1356">1356.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Journal 46, fos. 148b, 149.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_1357" name="note_1357" href="#noteref_1357">1357.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Original notification from the court at Whitehall, 22 March, 1667,

The office was
successively held by Thomas Middleton, Ben Jonson and Francis
Quarles. Ben Jonson's salary (100 nobles per annum) was stopped
in 1631 by order of the Court of Aldermen "until he shall have presented
to the court some fruits of his labours in that place" (Repertory
46, fo. 8); but it was renewed in 1634 at the intervention of the king
(Repertory 48, fo. 433). Further particulars relating to holders of this
office will be found fully recorded in the printed Index to Remembrancia

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
