<note place="margin"><p>The accession of James, 24 March, 1603.</p></note>

<p>The proclamation announcing James VI of Scotland
to be "by law, by lineal succession and undoubted
right," heir to the throne of England, now that
Elizabeth was dead, illustrates again the ancient right
of the citizens of London to a voice in electing a
successor to the crown. The document not only
acknowledges the assistance received by the lords of
the realm from the lord mayor, aldermen and citizens
of London in determining the succession, but at the
very head of the signatories to the proclamation
stands the name of "Robert Lee, Maior," precedence
being allowed him over the primate and other lords
spiritual and temporal.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fo. 73.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Correspondence between the king and the City.</p></note>

<p>Whatever failings the new king may have had,
he possessed sufficient shrewdness to know the value
of the favour of the City, which he hastened to
acknowledge with "thankfull mynde" within a few
days of his accession.<note place="foot"><p>Letter to the mayor, etc., of London, 28 March.—Journal 26,
fo. 75b.</p></note> A reply was sent to the king's
letter the following day, signed by the mayor and
aldermen, in which, after expressing their twofold
feelings of sorrow and joy—sorrow at losing a mother
in the late queen and joy at gaining a father in the
person of the new king—they declared they had used
all their powers to advance his just claim to the<pb n="002" /><anchor id="Pg002" />
crown, and would preserve the city of London, the
king's Chamber, against every enemy at home or
abroad. He was invited to notify his wishes to
them through their secretary or remembrancer, "Mr.
Doctor Fletcher," whom they sent as their special
messenger.<note place="foot"><p>Letter dated 29th March.—Journal 26, fo. 76. The Court of
Aldermen allowed Fletcher forty marks towards the expenses of his
journey.—Repertory 26, pt. i, fo. 119b.</p></note> The king returned for answer, that
although he had been already aware of the City's
forwardness in joining with the nobility in proclaiming
him rightful successor to the crown, he was pleased
to learn from their trusty messenger that the citizens
had advocated his cause not only from the consciousness
of its being a just one, but also because they
were assured of his zeal for the preservation of
religion.<note place="foot"><p>Letter dated Newcastle, 11th April, 1603.—Journal 26, fo. 80.
See Appendix.</p></note> This was one of James's mystifying
remarks which he was accustomed to throw out in
order to raise the hopes of the Catholics, who
questioned his title to the crown, whilst affording no
cause for alarm or discontent among the Protestants.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>James leaves Edinburgh for London, 5 April.</p></note>

<p>On the 5th April James left Edinburgh for
London, where every precaution was taken to
prevent disturbance by ridding the streets of rogues,
vagabonds and "masterless" men.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fos. 78b, 82, 82b, 88.</p></note> He proceeded
southward by easy stages, accompanied by a long
retinue of Scotsmen, until he reached Theobald's, at
that time the mansion house of Sir Robert Cecil, but
soon to become a royal hunting-lodge. On the
19th the mayor issued his precept to the livery
companies to prepare a certain number of members<pb n="003" /><anchor id="Pg003" /><index index="toc" level1="Reception of James I by the City." />
to accompany the mayor in his attendance upon the
king, who was shortly expected in the city. It was
intended that not only the mayor and aldermen but
also the full number of 500 of the "best and gravest"
citizens should wait upon his majesty on horseback,
clothed in coats of velvet with velvet sleeves and
adorned with chains of gold, and each accompanied
by "one comlie person, well apparelled in his doublet
and hose," on foot. In a word, the cavalcade was
to be furnished on a more sumptuous scale than had
yet been seen within the memory of man.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fo. 81b.</p></note> The
Court of Aldermen in the meantime appointed a
committee to consider what suits were "fitt to be
made to the Kinges most excellent Maiestye for
y<hi rend="vertical-align: super">e</hi> good of this Cittie and the enlarging of the
libertyes and priviledge of the same."<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 26, pt. i, fo. 131b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The citizens ride forth to meet him, 7 May.</p></note>

<p>After resting a few days at Theobald's, James set
out (7 May) for the last stage of his journey. At
Stamford Hill he was met by the mayor and aldermen
and a deputation from the livery companies. At
every stopping-place on his journey from Scotland
he had lavishly bestowed knighthoods.<note place="foot"><p>It is computed that more than 230 knights were created by James
on his passage from Edinburgh to the Tower. The lord mayor (Lee)
was knighted at Greenwich on the 22nd May. At the king's coronation,
which took place in July, all the aldermen of the city who were
not already knights were knighted at Whitehall.—Nichols, "Progresses
of King James I," i, 113n, 120, 234.</p></note> On the
11th May he entered the Tower of London, having
come from Whitehall by water for fear of the plague
which was ravaging the city.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The plague of 1603.</p></note>

<p>The coronation ceremony was hurried over owing
to the presence of the plague. Only the mayor,
the aldermen and twelve of the principal citizens<pb n="004" /><anchor id="Pg004" />
were permitted to attend, and much labour bestowed
on preparations for the event was consequently
lost.<note place="foot"><p>Howes's Chron., p. 827; Journal 26, fos. 74, 114b, 116b;
Repertory 26, pt. i, fo. 171.</p></note> The civic authorities did their utmost to stay
the sickness and alleviate distress. The streets
were ordered to be kept better cleansed. Infected
houses were marked with papers bearing the words
"Lord have mercy upon us," and when these were
torn down a red painted cross, fourteen inches in
length and breadth, and not so easily effaced, was
added.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fo. 98.</p></note> Persons stricken with the plague were
forbidden to leave their houses. A master who had
been inhuman enough to turn out into the street a
domestic servant who had fallen a victim to the
prevailing disorder was ordered by the Court of
Aldermen to take her back again into his house,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 26, pt. ii, fo. 361.</p></note> a
circumstance which seems to point to the pest-house
or hospital being already overcrowded. Instructions
were given for seeing that the graves of those who
died of the plague were sufficiently covered with
earth, and that the number of mourners attending
funerals should be as far as possible limited.
Women whose duty it was to search the bodies of
the dead, as well as all those who were brought into
contact with the sick, were forbidden to go abroad
unless they carried before them a red rod three feet in
length in order to give notice to passers by. It was
a common belief that infection was carried about by
stray dogs. To those, therefore, who killed dogs
found in the streets without an owner a reward was<pb n="005" /><anchor id="Pg005" />
given.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fos. 103b, 122b, 124b, 125b, 127; Repertory 26,
pt. i, fo. 149b. In May of the following year the king himself lost two
beagles, which had strayed and probably been killed.—Journal 26,
fo. 211b. In 1611 the queen also lost her dog, and a liberal reward was
offered for its recovery. The animal was described as being "lowe and
thicke, of a meene coulor, and his taile turninge up to the middle of his
backe."—Journal 28. fo. 284.</p></note> The sufferings of the afflicted were alleviated,
as far as circumstances permitted, by money subscribed
by the livery companies, which were further called
upon to forego their customary banquets in order to
relieve the poor.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 28, fos. 116, 126, 126b.</p></note> The plague was accompanied, as
was usually the case, with a scarcity of corn, and
again the assistance of the companies was invoked.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 28, fos. 145, 145b. The Merchant Taylors contributed the
largest quantity (936 qrs.): they were followed by the Grocers (874 qrs.),
the Mercers (820 qrs.), the Goldsmiths (809 qrs.), next to which came
the Drapers (768 qrs.) and the Haberdashers (724 qrs.).</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The king's public passage through the city, 15 Mar., 1604.</p></note>

<p>By the end of the year (1603) the city was
almost free of the plague, and in the following March
(1604) James determined to make his first public
entry into London. A sum of £400 was raised by
the livery companies<note place="foot"><p>The amount at which each company was assessed will be found
printed from the City's Records in Nichols' "Progresses of King
James I," i, 400, 401.</p></note> for furnishing pageants and
stands for the occasion, and steps were taken to
remove from the streets everything that might be
offensive to the king's eye or ear. Thursday, the
15th March, was the day fixed for his entry, and
from the preceding Wednesday until the following
Friday no refuse of any kind was to be thrown into
the street.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fos. 163, 164, 178, 179b.</p></note> It was further ordered that no church
bells should be rung before seven o'clock in the
evening of the eventful day, lest the noise should
prove offensive and hinder his majesty from hearing<pb n="006" /><anchor id="Pg006" />
the speeches that were to be made.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fo. 178b.</p></note> When all was
over and the pageants were about to be taken down,
the Court of Aldermen, with the frugal mind of men
of business, ordered the master and wardens of the
Company of Painter Stainers to examine the painters'
work bestowed on them, and report whether, in their
opinion, such work had been well and honestly
executed, and what amount of remuneration the
workmen deserved.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fos. 186, 188; Repertory 26, pt. ii, fo. 311.</p></note> It is said that the Recorder,
Sir Henry Montagu, welcomed the king on this
occasion with a speech, wishing him on behalf of the
city "a golden reigne," and that a cup of gold was
presented to the king, the queen and the young prince
who accompanied them respectively;<note place="foot"><p>Nichols, "Progresses of King James I," i, 360, 361.</p></note> but no record
of the speech or gifts appears in the City's archives.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Catholic Plots." /><note place="margin"><p>Catholic plots against the king, June, 1603.</p></note>

<p>One of the first questions James had to decide
on his accession to the throne was that of religious
toleration; and his settlement of the question was
anxiously looked for as well by the Puritans as the
Catholics. The fear lest the policy which the king
should advocate might prove adverse to their interests
determined the Catholics to resort to strong measures,
and the life of James was threatened by a series of
plots, as that of Elizabeth had been before him.
Among these was a plan for seizing the king at
Greenwich on Midsummer-day, 1603. The plan was
laid by a secular priest named William Watson, who
had previously sounded James as to his probable
attitude to the Catholics if he came to the throne,
Sir Griffin Markham, a Catholic gentleman, who for<pb n="007" /><anchor id="Pg007" />
private reasons was discontented with the government,
and one Antony Copley. News of the plot
having reached the government, the conspirators fled
for their lives. Proclamations were issued for their
capture,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 26, fos. 111, 117b, 118b.</p></note> in which details were given of their personal
appearance. Thus Watson was described as a man
of the lowest sort about thirty-six years of age, "he
lookethe a squinte and is verie purblynde," and had
formerly worn a long beard which he was believed to
have cut off; whilst Sir Griffin Markham is credited
with having a large broad face of a "bleake"
complexion, a big nose, and a hand maimed by a
bullet. His brethren "have all verie greate noses."
Copley's description is not given, but we have that of
another conspirator, William Clarke, a priest, whose
hair is represented as having been "betwixte redd and
yeallowe." The whole party was subsequently taken,
one after another, and their examination disclosed
traces of another conspiracy, the object of which was
to place Arabella Stuart on the throne.</p>

<p>The discovery of Watson's conspiracy—generally
known as the "Bye" or "Surprise" Plot—so alarmed
the king that he lost no time in making known his
intention to exact no longer the recusancy fines.
The result was such as might be expected. The
Puritans were disgusted, whilst the number of recusants
increased to such an alarming extent that in February,
1604, the king took the extreme measure of ordering
the expulsion of all Jesuits and Seminary priests from
the country before the 19th March,<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 174.</p></note> the day fixed for
the meeting of parliament.</p>

<pb n="008" /><anchor id="Pg008" />

<note place="margin"><p>The first parliament of James, Mar., 1604.</p></note>

<p>As soon as parliament met a crisis was felt to be
at hand; the new king and the Commons were for
the first time to measure their strength. The city's
representatives are duly recorded.<note place="foot"><p>Return to writ of parliament, 31 Jan.—Journal 26, fo. 171.</p></note> At the head of
them was Sir Henry Billingsley,<note place="foot"><p>For particulars of his life, see Remembrancia (Analytical Index),
p. 2n.</p></note> a former mayor, Sir
Henry Montague,<note place="foot"><p>Id. p. 23n.</p></note> recently appointed Recorder of the
city upon the king's own recommendation, Nicholas
Fuller, of whom little is known beyond the fact that
he came from Berkshire and married the daughter
of Nicholas Backhouse,<note place="foot"><p>Id., p. 176n.</p></note> alderman and grocer, and
Richard Gore, a merchant tailor.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Proposed union of England and Scotland.</p></note>

<p>With his customary self-complacency and patronising
air James told the assembled Commons that he
had brought them two gifts, the one peace abroad,<note place="foot"><p>Peace with Spain, for which negotiations had been entered into as
soon as James came to the throne, was concluded in the summer of this
year (18 Aug.), but was not acceptable to the nation at large, and much
less to the citizens of London. "I can assure your mightiness," wrote
the State's Ambassador, Caron, "that no promulgation was ever received
in London with more coolness—yes, with more sadness.... The people
were admonished to make bonfires, but you may be very sure not a
bonfire was to be seen."—Motley, "United Netherlands," iv, 223, 224.
For payments made by the city chamberlain to heralds on the occasion
of proclamation of the peace, see Repertory 26, pt. ii, fo. 436.</p></note>
and the other the union of England with Scotland under
the title of Great Britain,<note place="foot"><p>James assumed the title of King of Great Britain by proclamation
dated 20 Oct., 1604.—Journal 26, fo. 271.</p></note> and he expressed no little
surprise and indignation when he found that neither
one nor the other was acceptable. The question of
the union of the two kingdoms, seeing that it involved
some political difficulties necessary of solution,
was referred to a commission.<note place="foot"><p>King's writ of proclamation of the union to the mayor and sheriffs
of London, dated 22 Oct., 1604.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign>, <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Ibid.</foreign></p></note> James showed his<pb n="009" /><anchor id="Pg009" />
displeasure at the want of compliance displayed by
the Commons by refusing to accept a scheme of commutation
of his rights of purveyance and wardship,
which had now grown so burdensome.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Purveyance." /><note place="margin"><p>Attempt to put down purveyance.</p></note>

<p>The abuse of purveyance, more especially, had
become a standing grievance to the burgesses of
London as well as of other cities and towns, in
spite of attempted remedies by statute or charter.<note place="foot"><p>The first charter of Edward III, granted to the citizens of London
(6 March, 1327) with the assent of parliament, expressly forbade the
king's purveyors taking goods contrary to the will and pleasure of the
citizens, except for cash; and no prisage of wines was thenceforth to be
taken under any consideration.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Cf.</foreign> Stat. 4, Edw. III, c. 3; 5, Edw.
III, c. 2; 25, Edw. III, c. 1; 36, Edw. III, c. 2.</p></note>
An offer of £50,000 a year was made to the king
by way of commuting any shred of right he might
still have to purveyance after thirty-six statutes had
pronounced it altogether illegal. This, however, he
refused, and the matter was allowed to drop. Two
years later, almost to the day (23 April, 1606), the
king endeavoured so far to remedy the evil as to
issue a proclamation against exactions and illegal
acts of his purveyors,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fo. 36.</p></note> and yet scarcely a month
elapsed before the lord mayor had occasion to call
the attention of the lords of the council to the great
inconvenience caused in the city by their recent
demand for 200 carts with two horses to each, together
with the lord mayor's own barge, for the
purpose of conveying his majesty's effects to Greenwich.
As for the barge, the mayor wrote that the
lord chamberlain sometimes borrowed it for conveying
the king's guard, and it might haply be required again
for the same purpose, "but for carringe anie stuffe or
lugedge whereby it maie receave hurt it was never<pb n="010" /><anchor id="Pg010" />
yet required," and he hoped their lordships would
see the matter in that light.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, ii, 262 (Analytical Index, p. 409).</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="The City and Free Trade." /><note place="margin"><p>The House of  Commons and Free Trade.</p></note>

<p>Another important matter which occupied the
attention of the House at this session—although no
reference to it appears in the City's records of the day—was
the introduction of Free Trade, to the prejudice
of the chartered rights of various trading companies.
The citizens of London were deeply interested in the
bill which was introduced for this purpose, for although
it little affected the livery companies, it touched very
closely the interests of those companies which were
incorporated for the purpose of trading with foreign
countries, such as that of the Merchant Adventurers,
the Levant Company, the Russia Company, and
others. These companies had been formed at a time
when few individuals were sufficiently wealthy to
bear the risk of distant enterprises. Not every
citizen was a Whitington or a Gresham. The risk
incurred by these associations in undertaking voyages
to distant countries was compensated by the advantage
gained by the enjoyment of a monopoly of the trade
with those countries by charter from the Crown. At
the outset there had been no cry raised against
monopolies of this kind, but as time wore on and the
merchant navy increased, as it did in the last reign
with extraordinary rapidity, a feeling of jealousy
grew up on the part of shipowners who were not
members of one or other of these chartered companies.
By the beginning of the seventeenth century dissatisfaction
with the privileges of these trading
companies had become so general that appeals were<pb n="011" /><anchor id="Pg011" />
made to the Privy Council. These being without
effect, the whole matter was referred to a parliamentary
committee. No pains were spared to get at
the root of the grievance. The committee were
attended by "a great concourse of clothiers and
merchants of all parts of the realm and especially of
London."<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, 21 May, 1604, i, 218.</p></note> Counsel was heard in favour of the bill
which had been drafted for the purpose of throwing
open foreign trade to all merchants alike, and the
bill was supported by all the merchants attending
the committee with the exception of the merchants
of London, who were represented on the occasion by
the principal aldermen of the city. The free traders
urged the natural right of every one to the free
exercise of his own industry and the example set by
other nations. They declared that the passing of the
bill would lead to the more even distribution of
wealth,<note place="foot"><p>The fact that the custom dues of London amounted to £110,000
a year, whereas those of the rest of the kingdom amounted to only
£17,000, was adduced in support of their case.</p></note> the greater increase of shipping, and the
augmentation of the revenues of the Crown. The
upholders of the companies, on the other hand,
could find no better arguments in their favour than
that no company could be a monopoly inasmuch
as a monopoly was something granted exclusively
to a single individual, and that if the existence
of the companies was determined, apprenticeship
would cease and difficulties arise in collecting the
king's customs! After three days' debate on the

<index index="toc" level1="The Gunpowder Plot." /><note place="margin"><p>The gunpowder plot, 1604-1605.</p></note>

<p>The action of James in expelling the Jesuits and
Seminary priests had in the meantime so incensed the
Catholics that a plot was set on foot for blowing up
the king, the lords and commons, with gunpowder, as
soon as parliament should re-assemble. In May
(1604) a house had been hired by a Catholic named
Robert Catesby, through which access might be
gained to the basement of the parliament-house.
The party-wall, however, proved exceptionally thick,
and more than a year elapsed before the necessary
mining operations were complete. Catesby was
assisted in his work by a Spaniard named Guy
Fawkes, who assumed the name of John Johnson.
In the spring of 1605 the exasperation of the
Catholics was increased by James again imposing the
recusancy fines, and the little band of plotters
increased in numbers, although never allowed to
become large. The design of the conspirators was
rendered more easy of execution by the discovery
that a cellar reaching under the parliament-house
was to be let. This was hired by one of the plotters,<pb n="014" /><anchor id="Pg014" />
and a large quantity of gunpowder was safely
deposited there and carefully concealed. After
several adjournments parliament was summoned to
assemble on the 5th November. On the eve of its
meeting Fawkes entered the cellar with a lantern,
ready to fire the train in the morning. One of the
conspirators, however, Tresham by name, had given
his friends some hint of the impending danger.
Fawkes was seized and committed to the Tower,
where he was subjected to the most horrible torture
by the king's orders.<note place="foot"><p>The king to the lords commissioners [for the plot], 6 Nov.—Cal.

names being John Gerrard, Oswald Greenway, and
Henry Garnet. Gerrard and Greenway effected their
escape, but Garnet was captured after having suffered
much deprivation whilst in hiding, and was brought
to trial at the Guildhall. Gerrard is described as tall
and well set up, but his complexion "swart or
blackish, his face large, his cheeks sticking out and
somewhat hollow underneath," his hair long unless
recently cut, his beard cut close, "saving littell
mustachoes and a littell tuft under his lower lippe,"
his age about forty. Equally precise descriptions are<pb n="016" /><anchor id="Pg016" />

represented as of "meane stature, somewhat grosse,"
his hair black, his beard bushy and brown, his forehead

Gerrard; whilst Garnet is described as an older man,
between fifty and sixty years of age, of fair complexion,
full face and grisly hair, with a high forehead, and
corpulent.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fo. 17.</p></note> At his trial, which took place on the 28th

<index index="toc" level1="The City's Water Supply." /><note place="margin"><p>The city's water supply.</p></note>

<p>That the chief cause of the city being so often
visited by epidemics in former days was the lack of
a plentiful supply of wholesome water will scarcely
be denied. When we consider with what rapidity
the population of the city increased, more especially
under the Tudors, the short-sighted policy of a government
which forbade the erection of new buildings
within three miles of the city's gates,<note place="foot"><p>Proclamation, 7 July, 22 Eliz. (1580).—Journal 21, fo. 54.</p></note> and drove
so many families to find shelter under one roof within

to the contrary,<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia (Index), <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">s.v.</foreign> "Buildings."</p></note> the want of any organised
system of drainage, and the scanty supply of water—we
can only marvel that the city was ever free from
epidemics.</p>

<p>In 1543 the municipal authorities obtained
statutory powers to amend decayed conduits and
erect new ones, as well as to bring water to the
city from Hampstead,<note place="foot"><p>Stat. 35 Henry VIII, c. 10.</p></note> and from that time they
appear to have taken a more active interest in the
water supply. They made periodical visits to the
various conduits, and more especially the conduit-head<pb n="019" /><anchor id="Pg019" />
at Marylebone, where a banqueting-house was erected
for their convenience. Nevertheless they preferred
encouraging private individuals (and these not infrequently
foreigners) in attempts to improve the city's
water supply, as necessity arose, to undertaking the
work themselves in their corporate capacity. In 1570
the City acquired parliamentary powers to break soil
for the purpose of conveying water from the river Lea,
"otherwise called Ware River," at any time <emph>within
the next ten years</emph>,<note place="foot"><p>Stat. 13 Eliz., c. 18.</p></note> but these powers were allowed to
lapse by default. In 1581 Peter Morice, a Dutchman,
obtained permission to set up a water-mill in the Thames
at London Bridge, and by some mechanical contrivance—a
"most artificial forcier"—succeeded in conveying
water as far as Leadenhall and Gracechurch. The
civic authorities were so pleased with the result of his
first efforts that they assisted him with a loan of
£1,000 to perfect his work.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 21, fo. 251; Journal 22, fos. 47, 53b. The Common

<p>At length a scheme was started at the opening of
the seventeenth century which not only proved itself
equal to the task of supplying the ever-increasing
population of London with an adequate supply of
water, but was destined in after years to render its
undertakers rich "beyond the dreams of avarice."
The New River Company, the original shares of
which are of almost fabulous value at the present
day, had its commencement in an Act of Parliament
(3 James I, c. 18) which empowered the mayor,
commonalty and citizens of London and their

as to allow the City to convey water underground.</p></note> for
the purpose of bringing a fresh stream of running
water to the north parts of the city from springs at
Chadwell and Amwell, co. Herts. Whilst showing
themselves ready and anxious to render the city
more healthy and less subject to epidemics by cleansing
the city's ditches of all filth and draining
Finsbury and the Moorfields,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fos. 54, 77, 89b, 144b, 396; Journal 28, fos. 16b, 81.</p></note> the civic authorities
were appalled at the enormity of their own proposals,
and hesitated to carry out what at that time<pb n="021" /><anchor id="Pg021" />
appeared to be an engineering task of stupendous
difficulty. Three years elapsed and nothing was
done. Offers were made by various individuals to
execute the work for them, but these were declined.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fo. 89; Repertory 27, fos. 312, 269b.</p></note>
At length, on the 28th March, 1609, Hugh Middleton,
a goldsmith of London, but of Welsh extraction,
declared himself ready to undertake the work and to
complete it within four years. His offer was accepted,
and an agreement was drawn up and executed on the
21st April.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fo. 377b. Another agreement was subsequently drawn

the undertaking met with great opposition. Among
the various objections raised to the New River
scheme was one to the effect that the municipal
authorities had done nothing in the business themselves,
but had by Act of Common Council irrevocably
conveyed their whole interest in fee simple to
Middleton, who was carrying out the work "for his
own private benefit." To this objection answer was
made that if the mayor and citizens would not
adventure upon so uncertain a work Middleton
deserved the greater commendation in adventuring
his money and labour for the good of the city,
and if the city was benefited and the country not<pb n="022" /><anchor id="Pg022" />
prejudiced Middleton deserved all that he gained.<note place="foot"><p>See Paper containing "objections against the river," with answers.—Cal.

A bill was introduced into parliament to repeal the
Acts authorising the construction of the New River,
and a committee appointed (20 June, 1610) to survey
the damages caused or likely to be caused by the
work,<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, i, 442, 445.</p></note> and report thereon to the House. "Much

of a river and bringing it to London from ten or
twelve miles off, through the grounds of many
men who, for their particular interest, do strongly
oppose themselves to it, and are like (as 'tis said)
to overthrow it all." The bill was opposed by
the City. A deputation consisting of two aldermen,
the Town Clerk and the City Remembrancer
was appointed (25 May, 1610) to wait upon Sir
John Herbert, one of the principal Secretaries of
State, Sir Julius Cæsar, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and other influential members of parliament, for the
purpose of entreating them to use their efforts to
prevent the repeal of the statutes on the ground that
the stream of fresh water which would thereby be
brought to the north parts of the city would tend
to the preservation of health; that the work had
already been carried ten miles, and that Middleton
had already expended more than £3,000 in carrying
it out.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 29, fo. 231.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Pecuniary assistance granted to Middleton by James, May, 1612.</p></note>

<p>Middleton was eventually allowed to proceed
with his work, but the delay that had taken place
made it necessary for him to apply to the Common
Council for an extension of time within which to
complete it. The City readily consented to grant
him an extension of five years (27 Feb., 1611).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 28, fo. 176b.</p></note> No
application for pecuniary assistance however appears
to have been made to the City at this or any other
time whilst the work was in progress by Middleton,
although he lacked funds and was compelled in the
following year to seek the assistance of James
himself. The king was familiar with Middleton
and his undertaking, for the New River was carried past
his own hunting-lodge of Theobalds. In May (1612)
he agreed to pay half the cost of the whole work on
condition that Middleton would convey to him one-half
of the property. Middleton could not do otherwise
than accept the king's offer, and in the following
August executed a deed conveying thirty-six shares to
James.<note place="foot"><p>These "king's shares," as they were called to distinguish them
from "adventurers' shares," were sold by Charles I in 1636 for an

they have been subjected to frequent sub-division. At a sale by

<p>Even then the whole enterprise might have failed

exclusion of other supplies. In 1616, three years
after the New River had been opened, the lords of the
council wrote (23 Dec.) to the mayor and aldermen
informing them that it was the king's wish that, inasmuch
as few persons used the new supply, the city
authorities should see that all such houses as could
conveniently use it should be made to use it, for it was
not to be supposed, said they, that two Acts of
Parliament and an Act of Common Council affecting

no other purpose than to injure those who undertook
so useful a work on the part of the city.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia (Index), p. 557.</p></note> So again,

<p>A year after Middleton had been created a
baronet the Court of Aldermen voted him (13 Nov.,
1623) a gold chain of the value of 200 marks in
recognition of his services in supplying the city with
water, and thereby preventing the spread of disastrous
fires.  Only the night before (12 Nov.) "a very<pb n="026" /><anchor id="Pg026" />
terrible and fearful fire" had broken out, destroying
many houses, and among them that of Sir William
Cockaine, in Broad Street, and causing damage to the
extent of £40,000 and more;<note place="foot"><p>"Court and Times of James I," ii, 433.</p></note> and the Court of
Aldermen, in recording their vote, testified to the
great danger which would have threatened the city
had not a plentiful supply of water, thanks to
Middleton, been at hand.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 38, fo. 12; Letter Book II, fo. 51.</p></note> The chain was set with

<note place="margin"><p>Death of Middleton, 10 Dec, 1631.</p></note>

<p>All this time the City's loan to Middleton remained
outstanding, and indeed it remained unrepaid
at the time of his death in December, 1631, a
circumstance which shows that the greatest engineer
of the age died worse off than many believe.
After considerable hesitation the Court of Aldermen
instructed the City Solicitor to recover the money by
suing on Middleton's bond.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 47, fos. 45b, 58, 89b, 105b, 300b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Grant of £1,000 to Lady Middleton, 1634.</p></note>

<p>If other evidence were wanting to show that
Middleton died in reduced circumstances there is
the fact that his widow was compelled, soon
after her husband's death, to seek satisfaction from
the City for losses sustained by his estate by means of
"many breaches made in the pipes of water and
otherwise upon occasion of divers great fires." After
considering the matter for close upon two years
the Common Council at length agreed (2 Oct., 1634)
to raise a sum of £1,000 for her by assessment on the<pb n="027" /><anchor id="Pg027" />
wards, but hesitated whether to pay the money to
Lady Middleton for her own use or as executrix only
of the will of her late husband, "to be distributed
according to the custome of this Citty whereof he
dyed a Freeman." The court added this condition
to the gift, viz.: that the City should be allowed to
set up cocks in connection with the New River pipes
in each ward, to be used in cases of fire, in place of
cutting the pipes, as had been the custom on such
occasions.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 36, fos. 37, 292, 292b.</p></note> In 1635 Middleton's loan remained still
owing to the City, and the £1,000 promised to his
widow was not yet collected. On the 12th May
Lady Middleton petitioned the Court of Aldermen to
allow the £1,000 to be accepted in part payment of
her late husband's debt and she would endeavour
forthwith to discharge the remainder. To this the
court acceded.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 49, fo. 195b.</p></note></p>

<p>In 1726 the New River Company petitioned the
Common Council for a direct conveyance to be made to
the company of all the statutory rights and privileges
the City had originally made over to Middleton. The
reason given for this request was that the company
found themselves obliged at the time to prosecute a
number of trespassers, and that it had been advised
by counsel that in order to get a verdict in the
company's favour it would have to prove its title,
"through all times and through all the mean conveyances,"
from the passing of the original Act of
Parliament to the present time. The company
represented that such a proceeding would involve
enormous difficulty, but this difficulty could be
got over if the City would consent to give an<pb n="028" /><anchor id="Pg028" />
immediate grant to the company of all that they had
formerly conveyed to Middleton, and upon the same
terms. The matter, urged the company, was one
that affected the interests of the City, for unless the
offenders were punished the water of the New River
would continue to be intercepted before it reached
the city. The petition was referred to the City
Lands Committee for consideration.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 57, fos. 143b, 144.</p></note></p>

<p>Just at the time when the City was meditating
a transfer of their powers under the New River Acts
to Middleton, a scheme was being set on foot for
colonising a vast tract of land in the north of Ireland,
which, after the flight of the earls of Tyrone and
Tyrconnel in 1607, was declared to be confiscated to
the Crown. In October, 1608, commissioners had
been appointed to draw up a plan for the proposed
colonisation, or, as it was called, the "Plantation of
Ulster," and by the following January (1609) their
reports were sent in.<note place="foot"><p>Report of Commissioners, 20 Dec., 1608; Second Report, Jan.,
1609.—Cal. State Papers Ireland (1608-1610), pp. 117, 139.</p></note> The next step was the
formulating of orders and conditions to be observed
by the undertakers of the plantation, and by
the end of January these were ready, although
they do not appear to have been published before
the following March.<note place="foot"><p>"Orders and Conditions of the Ulster Plantation."—Cal. State

these orders and conditions was to attract persons
to take a share in the work of the plantation,
not so much with the view of benefiting themselves
as of doing service to the Crown and<pb n="029" /><anchor id="Pg029" />
commonwealth. Whatever attraction the scheme as
put forth in this Collection of Orders and Conditions—often
referred to in subsequent proceedings as the
"printed book"—may have had for others, it had none
for the Londoner.<note place="foot"><p>See the City's Petition to the House of Commons, in Jan., 1641.—Journal
39, fo. 164.</p></note> The city merchant and trader
required to be assured of some substantial benefit to
be gained by himself before he would embark in any
such undertaking, and in order to give him this
assurance he was asked to consider a long list of
"motives and reasons to induce the City of London
to undertake plantation in the north of Ireland."<note place="foot"><p>Cal. State Papers Ireland (1608-1610), pp. 207-210.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Motives and reasons to encourage the City to take part in the plantation, 28 May, 1609.</p></note>

<p>In this document, bearing date the 28th May,
1609, the king offered to make over to the city of
London the city of Derry and another place near
the castle of Coleraine with adjacent territory, and
with exceptional advantages as to custom dues and
admiralty jurisdiction. As an inducement to accept
the king's offer the citizens were assured that the
country was well watered and suitable for breeding
cattle; it grew hemp and flax better than elsewhere;
it was well stocked with game and had excellent sea
and river fisheries, and it contained such abundance
of provisions as not only to supply the plantation,
but also assist towards the relief of the London poor.
Besides these advantages the city, which was so
overcrowded "that one tradesman was scarcely able
to live by another," would have an opportunity of
getting rid of some of its surplus population, and at
the same time render itself less liable to infectious
diseases. If the citizens wanted a precedent for what<pb n="030" /><anchor id="Pg030" />
they were now called upon to undertake, they were
invited to look at what Bristol had done for Dublin
in the reign of Henry II. The plantation of Dublin
by Bristol, which reflected "eternal commendation"
on the latter city, had done much towards civilising and
securing that part of Ireland, and it was greatly to be
hoped that the precedent so set would now be followed
by London, more especially as the advantages to be
gained were far greater.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The matter laid before a special Court of Aldermen, 1 July, 1609.</p></note>

<p>A goodly prospect indeed; but still the enterprise
failed to commend itself to the Londoner. A
month went by and nothing was done. At length,
on Saturday, the 1st July, the matter was brought
direct to the attention of a special Court of Aldermen
and "divers selected comoners" of the city by the
lords of the council. Again the citizens were assured
that by taking a part in the work of the plantation
they would not only be doing a work acceptable unto
God but one which would be at once honourable and
profitable to themselves.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Referred to the livery companies.</p></note>

<p>The project was received with favour to the
extent that it was resolved to invite the livery
companies to consider the matter, and to appoint
committees to make suggestions to the court in
writing by the following Wednesday (5 July),<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 29, fo. 52b.</p></note> and
precepts to the companies were issued accordingly.
The reply sent by the companies appears to have
been considered unsatisfactory, for on the following
Saturday (8 July) the mayor issued another precept
rebuking them for the attitude taken up by their
representatives, who had not, in his opinion, paid<pb n="031" /><anchor id="Pg031" />
sufficient attention to the matter nor fully realised
the motives and reasons which had been propounded.
He bade them reconsider the matter and send their
representatives to the Guildhall on Friday, 14th July,
with "such reasons and demands as are fit to be
remembered, required or considered of in the undertaking
of so great and honourable an action" set
down in writing.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fo. 386b. The following were the companies to
whom, in addition to the twelve principal companies, the precept was
sent:—Dyers, Leathersellers, Pewterers, Cutlers, Whitebakers, Tallow
Chandlers, Armourers, Girdlers, Saddlers, Barber-Surgeons, Plumbers,
Innholders, Coopers, Joiners, Weavers, Woodmongers, Scriveners,
Stationers and Embroiderers.</p></note> Accordingly, on the 14th, the
committees of the various companies appeared before
the Court of Aldermen with their answer in writing,
and a deputation was nominated to carry their answer
to the lords and to hear anything more that they
might have to say on the matter.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 29, fo. 60b. The answer of the companies is not
entered, a blank space being left.</p></note></p>

<p>The lords of the council being angry with the
companies for sending in their answer before a conference
had been held with them, the Recorder was
instructed to inform them that the companies had
acted under a mistake, and intended nothing undutiful
in what they had done, and a deputation was again
nominated to confer with their lordships.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 29, fo. 61b.</p></note> This was
on Tuesday, the 18th July.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>A conference with the lords of the council.</p></note>

<p>Before the end of the week "a full and large
conference" took place, and the lords of the council
so satisfied the representatives of the companies of
the profitable nature of the undertaking that they
were encouraged to become adventurers. It was an<pb n="032" /><anchor id="Pg032" />
understood thing between the parties that the citizens
should send their own representatives over to Ireland
to view the property, and if the undertaking proved to
be otherwise than had been represented, and unprofitable,
they were to be at liberty to withdraw from it
altogether. The result of the conference was signified
to the masters and wardens of the several companies
on Monday, the 24th July, by precept of the mayor,
who enjoined them to call together their companies on
the following Wednesday, and after explaining the
whole matter to them, to learn from each individual
member what amount he was prepared to contribute
towards the furtherance of so "famous a project," and
to cause the same to be entered in a book "to the intent
his majesty may be informed of the readiness of this
city in a matter of such great consequence." A
note was to be made of any who refused to contribute,
and those who failed to attend the summons were to
be fined. No time was to be lost, for the lords of the
council expected a return of the amount to be contributed
by the companies by Friday (28 July).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fo. 387b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Commissioners appointed by the City to view the plantation, 1 Aug., 1609.</p></note>

<p>On Sunday, the 30th July, a deputation of
aldermen and commoners again waited on the lords
of the council, and received permission to elect four
wise, grave and discreet citizens to cross over to
Ireland and view the proposed plantation. On Tuesday
(1 Aug.) the Common Council nominated John
Broad, goldsmith, Hugh Hamersley, haberdasher,
Robert Treswell, painter-stainer, and John Rowley,
draper, to be the City's commissioners for the purpose.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 27, fo. 398. John "Mun," or "Muns," mercer, was afterwards

<p>The lords of the council anticipated the arrival
of the City's agents in Ireland by directing Sir
Thomas Philips to accompany them in their travels,
and by sending instructions to Sir Arthur Chichester,
the deputy, to see that they were well supplied
with necessaries and were assisted in every way.
The latter was more particularly instructed to use
great care in the selection of discreet persons to
conduct and accompany them, men who from their
experience and understanding might be able, "both
by discourse and reason, to controule whatsoever
any man shall reporte either out of ignorance or
malice, and to give the undertakors satisfaccon
when they shalbe mistaken or not well informed of
any particular."<note place="foot"><p>Two letters from the lords of the council to Sir Arthur
Chichester, 3 Aug., 1609.—Philadelphia Papers (Transcripts, Public
Record Office), vol. i, pp. 498-501.</p></note> The conductors were to take
care to lead the Londoners by the best roads, and to
lodge them on their journeys where they might, if
possible, receive English entertainment in Englishmen's
houses. The lords of the council at the same
time forwarded to Sir Arthur Chichester a copy of the
"Project," and desired him to see that those who
conducted the City's agents were "well prepared
before-hand to confirme and strengthen every part
thereof by demonstracon as they may plainly
apprehend and conceive the commodities to be of
good use and profit." On the other hand, matters
of distaste, such as fear of the Irish, of the soldiers,
of cess and such like must not be so much as
named. These could be set right afterwards and
were only matters of discipline and order. Lastly,
if the Londoners should happen to express a wish<pb n="034" /><anchor id="Pg034" />
respecting anything, "whether it be the fishing, the
admirallty, or any other particuler w<hi rend="vertical-align: super">ch</hi> may serve
for a motyve to enduce them," the same was
to be conceded at once, and no private interests,
whether of Sir Arthur Chichester himself or any
other individual, were to be allowed to stand in
the way.</p>

<p>These instructions were carried out to the letter,
and the City's representatives, as soon as they set foot
in Ireland, were treated right royally. Sir John Davys,
one of the king's commissioners engaged in surveying
the country, wrote home on the 28th August<note place="foot"><p>Sir John Davys to Salisbury, 28 Aug., 1609.—Cal. State Papers
Ireland (1608-1610), pp. 280-281.</p></note>: "The
Londoners are now come, and exceeding welcome
to us. Wee all use our best rhetorick to persuade
them to go on w<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> their plantation, w<hi rend="vertical-align: super">ch</hi> will assure
the whole island to the crowne of England forever.
They like and praise the cuntrey very much,
specially the Banne and the river of Loghfoyle."
He goes on to say that one of the City's agents had
fallen sick, and would have returned, but the lord-deputy
and the rest had used every means to comfort
and retain him, "lest this accident shold discourage
his fellow cittizens." In other respects, too, they saw
the country at its best, for they arrived at a time when
the Irish were flocking in and making their submission
in far better fashion than they had done for years. So
pleased were they with what they saw that they assured
Sir Arthur Chichester that the City would certainly
undertake the plantation upon the report they were
about to make. The deputy on his part assured
them that if the Londoners did not undertake the<pb n="035" /><anchor id="Pg035" />
work they would be enemies to themselves. He
suggested that they should send home to the lord
mayor some samples of the commodities of the
country. The suggestion was adopted, and he
obtained for them some raw hides, tallow, salmon,
herrings, eels, pipe-staves, beef and the like at a
cheap rate. He also procured them some iron ore
and promised to furnish them with samples of lead
and copper.<note place="foot"><p>Sir Arthur Chichester to Salisbury, 18 Sept., 1609.—Cal. State

together with an answer made by Sir Arthur
Chichester to certain questions they had put to him
on doubtful points, and also a map or "plott" of the
country they had viewed. The court in the first

<p>On Friday, the 15th, the committee were ready
with their report. They had met five times, and had
held long debate and consultation on the various
matters incident to "so great a business," and on
each and all of these they had something to say. As
to the financial part of the undertaking they were of
opinion that the Common Council should pass an Act
for raising a sum of £15,000, and no more, upon the
members of the wealthier livery companies, by poll,
the inferior companies being spared. The report
having been approved by the court a deputation was

City's answer on the following Sunday (17 December).<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 19-20b.</p></note></p>

<p>When the lords of the council came to consider

but the clause which restricted the amount of money
to be furnished by the City to £15,000, and no more,
was "much distasted" by them, seeing that that sum
would scarcely suffice to buy up private interests, let
alone the work of plantation. The City's offer in

with commissioners appointed by the Privy Council

Grocers (the next highest in the corn assessment) £1,748, the Mercers
£1,640, and so on in a descending scale to the Bowyers, the Fletchers,

companies are now exceedinglie overcharged and

make any alteration in the payment of the first two
instalments, as the plantation was to commence in the
summer,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 28, fos. 53, 53b.</p></note> but a new assessment for corn was made

their agent, and he and others would shortly set out
for Ireland. The lords commended him to the deputy's
care, and he was instructed to see that they were
furnished with a sufficient number of labourers for
felling timber, digging stone and burning lime. Sir

<p>It was no easy task the City had undertaken.
Great difficulty was experienced in getting the companies
to pay up their quota of the £20,000 to be
raised for the purpose of the plantation. The
wardens of the Mercers, the Clothworkers and other
companies were committed to prison by order of the
Court of Aldermen for refusing or failing to pay the
sums at which their respective companies had been
assessed.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 29, fos. 219b, 235b, 250b, 253b, 254.</p></note> The masters or wardens of the companies
were not so much to blame as the individual members
of the companies who refused to pay. Thus, a sum of
£200 due from Sir John Spencer, the rich Clothworker,
remained unpaid at his death. It was eventually
paid by his son-in-law, Lord Compton, after much
solicitation.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia (Index), p. 172.</p></note> Even when the money was got in there
was a difficulty in forwarding it to its destination, so

Coleraine.<note place="foot"><p>Chichester to Salisbury, 27 June, 1610.—Cal. State Papers Ireland

<p>Early in the following year (31 Jan., 1611) the
livery companies were called upon to certify to the
Irish Society, within one week, whether or no they
were willing to accept an allotment of the Irish estate
proportionate to the money by them advanced, and to<pb n="040" /><anchor id="Pg040" />
cultivate and plant the same at their own cost and
charges, according to the "printed book" of the
plantation, or leave the letting and disposing thereof
to the governor and committees. They were warned
that, in any case, they would still have to contribute
towards the charge of building houses and fortifications
and freeing of tithes.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 28, fos. 159b, 163.</p></note> In response to the
mayor's precept eight of the principal companies of
the city, viz., the Mercers, Grocers, Drapers,
Fishmongers, Goldsmiths, Salters, Ironmongers and
Vintners, and ten of the inferior companies, viz., the
Dyers, Pewterers, Founders, Whitebakers, Broderers,
Armourers, Tilers and Bricklayers, Blacksmiths,
Weavers and Woodmongers, signified their willingness
to accept a proportionate part of the land (27 Feb.).
The remainder of the companies preferred to leave
the lands alone, but they were allowed to come in
afterwards if they saw reason to change their mind.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 176.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>A further sum of £10,000 to be raised for the plantation, July, 1611.</p></note>

<p>By July (1611) nearly the whole of the £20,000
had been expended. The Common Council thereupon
resolved that a further sum of £10,000 should be
levied on the companies at the same rate as the last
two payments. A day was appointed for the companies
to send in a written notice whether they agreed
to contribute to this fresh sum or were ready to forfeit
the money they had already subscribed and lose all
their right in the plantation.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 28, fos. 239b, 240.</p></note>. £5,000 was to be ready
by the 10th August. The remainder was not demanded

<p>Hitherto the agreement between the lords of the

out by one side only. The City had found the money
wherewith to carry out the work of the plantation,
but as yet not an acre of land had been assigned. It
is not surprising, therefore, that when the Grocers'
Company were called upon to contribute their <emph>quota</emph>
to the £5,000 demanded in July, 1612, they desired
the lord mayor not to press the matter until the

Council found itself under the unpleasant necessity of
asking the companies for another £10,000 within a

Not only had the whole of the £30,000 formerly
subscribed been expended, but the Irish Society had

<p>James had already begun to show impatience—even
before the granting of the charter of incorporation
to the Irish Society—at the little progress made in the
work of the plantation. At the close of the last year
(21 Dec., 1612) he had himself written to Sir Arthur
Chichester directing him to send home an account of
what the Londoners had done; for, notwithstanding
their pretence of great expenditure, there was, so he<pb n="042" /><anchor id="Pg042" />
was informed, little outward show for it.<note place="foot"><p>Cal. State Papers Ireland (1611-1614), p. 310.</p></note> Fault was

<p>On Midsummer-day (1613) Sir Henry Montague,
the Recorder, and Sir William Cockaine, the governor
of the Irish Society, signified to the Common Council
that it was the king's wish that the walls and
fortifications of Derry should be at once taken in
hand. The court agreed to lose no time in carrying
out the king's wishes, and further resolved to despatch
"some great and worthy magistrate," as well as
"some commoner of special countenance and credit,"
to take an exact notice, view and account of the whole
work of the plantation, and of all works done and to
be done, and, in a word, to do all that they deemed
necessary for the good of the plantation. The choice
of the court fell upon Alderman George Smithes and
Matthias Springham, a Merchant Taylor.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 29, fo. 74b, 75.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Their report submitted to the Common Council, 8 Nov., 1613.</p></note>

<p>These two proceeded to Ireland, and, having
viewed the plantation, sent home from Dublin a
detailed report of all they had seen and done.<note place="foot"><p>The report was dated Dublin, 15 Oct.—Journal 29, fos. 116b-118.</p></note> The
report was submitted to the Common Council on the
8th November (1613). Among other things they had
taken great pains to make an equal division of the land
as far as was possible into twelve parts, with the view of
distributing it among the livery companies as proposed,<pb n="043" /><anchor id="Pg043" />
and a "plott" of the division was laid before the
court. But they were of opinion that the city of
Londonderry and its land of 4,000 acres, and the town
of Coleraine with its 3,000 acres, its ferries and fisheries,
could not be conveniently divided, but the rents and
profits of them might be divided among the several
companies. As to the fortification of Derry, the
commissioners had consulted ten military experts on
the matter and plans had been drafted; but it was
necessary to gather material before the wall could
be commenced, and this the commissioners recommended
should be taken in hand at once.</p>

<p>On the 17th December lots were publicly drawn
to decide the particular lands which each of the
twelve principal companies, combined with several of
the inferior companies in such a way as to make their
total contributions to amount, as far as might be, to

mortmain. This licence was expressly granted "to

<note place="margin"><p>The right of the companies to sell their Irish estate questioned.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>The select Parliamentary Committee of 1890.</p></note>

<p>In years gone by, when some of the companies
sold their Irish estate, there was no question as to
their power of alienation or their absolute right to the
proceeds of the sale, but of late years a cry has been
raised that the companies held their estates in a
fiduciary capacity, and that they could not legally
alienate their Irish property without accounting for
the proceeds of the sale as public trustees. It had got
abroad that those companies who had not already
parted with their Irish estates—as the Haberdashers
had done as far back as the year 1675, and the Merchant
Taylors, the Goldsmiths and the Vintners,
between the years 1728 and 1737—were meditating a
sale. In response to the cry thus raised a select
Parliamentary Committee was appointed to enquire
"as to the Terms of the Charters or other Instruments<pb n="045" /><anchor id="Pg045" />
by which their Estates in Ireland were granted to
the Irish Society and to the London companies, and
as to the Trusts and Obligations (if any) attaching
to the Ownership of such Estates." Any trust or
obligation in connection with the tenure of these
estates would naturally be comprised within the four
corners of the charters and instruments mentioned in
the order of reference just cited, but these the committee
practically ignored, on the ground that the
task of pronouncing with decisive authority upon their
legal construction could only be performed by a
judicial tribunal.<note place="foot"><p>Report of Select Committee on Irish Society and the London
Companies (Irish estates), 4 May, 1891, p. iii.</p></note> We have it, however, on the

<index index="toc" level1="The City and the Plantation of Virginia." /><note place="margin"><p>The plantation of Virginia, 1609.</p></note>

<p>Contemporaneously with the plantation of
Ulster, another and more distant enterprise of somewhat
similar character was being carried out in
America; and to this, as to every great public
undertaking, the citizens of London must need be
called to lend their assistance. A company formed
in 1606, and composed, in part at least, of London
merchants, the object of which was the colonisation
of Virginia, had proved a failure after a hopeless
struggle for three years. It was therefore determined
to reconstruct the company on a different
basis and to make an entirely fresh start.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Application to the City for assistance.</p></note>

<p>In the spring of 1609 the company wrote to
Sir Humphrey Weld,<note place="foot"><p>The letter is not entered on the City's Records, but it will be found
printed in the late Mr. Clode's "Memorials of the Merchant Taylors'
Company" and in Mr. Brown's "Genesis of the United States," i, 252.
The letter does not bear any date, but must have been written before the
16th March, 1609, as on that day the mayor issued his precept to the
several companies, enclosing a copy of the letter, and asking them to
"make some adventure" in so good and honourable an undertaking.—Journal
27, fo. 346b.</p></note> then mayor of London, for
assistance in financing the undertaking, urging him at
the same time to diminish the risk of pestilence and
famine in the city by removing the surplus population
to Virginia. For the sake of convenience they
purposed to issue no bills of adventure for less than
£12 10<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr>, but if his lordship were to make any
"ceasement" (assessment) or raise subscriptions from<pb n="047" /><anchor id="Pg047" />
the best disposed and most able of the companies, the
council and company of the plantation would be
willing to give bills of adventure to the masters and
wardens for the general use and behoof of each
company, or in the case of subscription by the wards
to the alderman and deputy of each ward for the
benefit of the ward. Should the emigrants "demaund
what may be theire present mayntenaunce, what
maye be theire future hopes?" they might be told
that the company was for the present prepared to
offer them "meate, drinke and clothing, with an
howse, orchard and garden for the meanest family,
and a possession of lands to them and their posterity."
Any alderman of the city subscribing £50 would be
reckoned as an original member of the council of the
company, and take equal share of the profits with the
rest; their deputies, too, would be admitted to the
same privileges on payment of half that sum.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Contributions by the livery companies.</p></note>

<p>In response to a precept no less than fifty-six
companies agreed to take ventures in the plantation.
The Grocers subscribed the sum of £487 10<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr>, or more
than double the amount subscribed by any other
company. The Mercers, the Goldsmiths and the
Merchant Taylors contributed respectively the next
highest amount, viz., £200; whilst the Drapers and
Fishmongers subscribed severally £150, the Stationers
£125, the Clothworkers £100, and the Salters £50.
In addition to these contributions made by the
companies in their corporate capacity other sums
were ventured by individual members.<note place="foot"><p>Brown's "Genesis of the United States," ii, 857, <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">seq.</foreign></p></note> Bills of
adventure were thereupon given to the several<pb n="048" /><anchor id="Pg048" />
companies for the money subscribed, entitling them
to have rateably "theire full parte of all such lands,
tenements and hereditaments" as should from time
to time be recovered, planted and inhabited, as also
"of all such mines and minerals of gould, silver and
other metals or treasure, pearles, precious stones, or
any kind of wares or marchaundizes, comodities or
profitts whatsoever," as should be obtained or gotten
in the voyage.<note place="foot"><p>See bill of adventure granted to the Merchant Taylors' Company,
4 May, 1609 (printed from the company's archives).—Brown, i, 308.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The company's new charter, 23 May, 1609.</p></note>

<p>With the assistance thus afforded by the citizens
of London the Virginia Company had no difficulty in
obtaining another charter from the Crown (23 May,
1609). Among the adventurers to whom the charter
was granted, and who embraced representatives of
every rank, profession and occupation, we find
Humphrey Weld, the mayor, whose name immediately
follows those of the peers of the realm who
shared in the undertaking, and Nicholas Ferrar,
skinner, who died in 1620, and gave by will "£300 to
the college in Virginia, to be paid when there shall
be ten of the infidels' children placed in it, and in the
meantime twenty-four pounds by the yeare to be
disbursed unto three discreete and godly men in the
colonie, which shall honestly bring up three of the
infidels' children in Christian religion and some good
course to live by."<note place="foot"><p>Brown, i, 208-237; ii, 890.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Outbreak of yellow fever among the colonists.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime (15 May) seven vessels with
emigrants on board had set sail from Woolwich.
After frequent delays on the south coast of England
they crossed the Atlantic and reached their destination<pb n="049" /><anchor id="Pg049" />
on the 11th August. Yellow fever had unfortunately
broken out on board ship during the long voyage,
and this, together with the plague, which is generally
believed to have been conveyed to Virginia by the
fleet, committed great havoc among the early emigrants.<note place="foot"><p>Brown, i, 329.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The company again re-constructed, 12 March, 1612.</p></note>

<p>It was not long before more money was wanted,
and again application was made to the livery companies.
The Mercers declined to make any further
advance;<note place="foot"><p>Letter from the clerk of the company to Mr. Brown, 18 April,
1885.—"Genesis of the United States," i, 442.</p></note> but with the assistance of the other companies
the sum of £5,000 was raised, which was
afterwards increased to £18,000.<note place="foot"><p>Brown, i, 465-469.</p></note> Nevertheless, in
spite of every exertion, the company was in the
autumn of 1611 on the very verge of ruin, and
something had to be done to prevent its utter collapse.
It was accordingly again re-constructed, its domains
were made to comprise the Bermudas, or Somers
Islands, and a third charter granted (12 March, 1612),
in which a number of citizens are named as having
become adventurers since the last letters patent.<note place="foot"><p>Id., ii, 540-553.</p></note></p>

<p>A special feature of the charter was the authorisation
of one or more lottery or lotteries to be held for
the benefit of the company,<note place="foot"><p>Art. xvi.</p></note> by virtue of which a
lottery was soon afterwards opened in London. The

Taylors' Company in their venture in the lottery of
1569.<note place="foot"><p>Vid. sup., vol. i, p. 507.</p></note> The City's records are unaccountably silent
on the matter of this lottery, but we learn from
other sources that the Grocers' Company adventured
the sum of £62 10<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> of their common goods and drew
a prize of £13 10<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> An offer being made to them to

amounting to the sum of £14 19<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> 1<abbr rend="font-style: italic">d.</abbr>, the company
resolved to accept the salt, "both in respect it would
not be so much losse to the company ... and
alsoe in regard this company wants salts." The
balance of £1 9<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> was ordered to be paid out of the
common goods of the company.<note place="foot"><p>Extract from Grocers' records.—Brown, ii, 591.</p></note> Not only the companies
but several of the city parishes had ventures
in a small way in the lottery. Thus the vestry of
St. Mary Colechurch agreed (7 June) to adventure
the sum of £6 of the church stock, whereby the
church was the gainer of "twoe spones, price twenty
shillinge."<note place="foot"><p>Extract from Vestry Minutes.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign>, ii, 571-572.</p></note> The parish of St. Mary Woolchurch
adventured a less sum, taking only fifty lots at a
shilling apiece, in return for which it got a prize
of ten shillings.<note place="foot"><p>Extract from Churchwardens' book.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign>, ii, 572.</p></note> That the lottery was not taken
up in the way it was hoped it would be is shown
by the fact that just before the drawing—which
took place in a house at the west end of St. Paul's,
and lasted from the 29th June till the 20th July—no
less than 60,000 blanks were taken out, in<pb n="051" /><anchor id="Pg051" />

of the adventurers.<note place="foot"><p>Howes's Chron. (ed. 1615), p. 913.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The public lottery of 1614.</p></note>

<p>Two years later (1614) another lottery for the
same purpose was set on foot. On the 1st April the
lords of the council addressed a circular letter to the
city companies,<note place="foot"><p>Neither this letter nor anything else connected with this lottery
appears to be entered on the City's Records. The letter will be found
printed (whence taken we are not told) in Brown's "Genesis of the
United States," ii, 685. The letter is not entered in the Minute Book
of the Merchant Taylors' Company, as was the former letter.</p></note> enclosing a copy of a pamphlet by
Sir Thomas Smith, entitled "A declaration of the
present estate of the English in Virginia, with the
final resolucon of the Great Lotterye intended for
their supply," and exhorting them to do their best
to make the lottery a success. The object is there
described as a "worthy and Christian enterprise, full of
honour and profitt to His Majestie and the whole
realme." A copy of this letter was forwarded to
the several companies through Sir Thomas Middleton,
the mayor,<note place="foot"><p>For the mayor's letter on this occasion, see Brown, ii, 688.</p></note> who, as we have already said, was himself
a member of the Council of the Virginia Company in
1609. The lotteries, however, found but little favour
with the companies, who were actively engaged at
the time in managing their recently acquired Irish
estates, and had but little money to spare. The
Merchant Taylors' Company contented themselves
with voting only £50 out of their common stock for
the lottery, leaving it to individual members to venture
further sums on their own account as each might
think fit.<note place="foot"><p>Clode, "Early Hist. of the Merchant Taylors' Company," p. 325.</p></note> The Grocers' Company, of which
Middleton was a member, voted nothing out of their<pb n="052" /><anchor id="Pg052" />
common stock, but each member was exhorted "for
the general advancement of Christianity and good of
the commonwealth," to write with his own hands
how much he was willing to venture. This was
accordingly done (15 April), the lord mayor himself
setting the example; but as to the result the
company's records fail to give any information.<note place="foot"><p>Brown, ii, 686-688.</p></note></p>

against the importation of tobacco. The Company
was already in disgrace with the House, through
the indiscretion of Counsel employed to prosecute a
petition on its behalf, and all the members of the
Company who held seats in the House were desired
to withdraw until it should be decided what action
should be taken in the matter. Eventually peace was

<note place="margin"><p>Vagrant children sent to Virginia, 1618-1619.</p></note>

<p>In 1618 a scheme was set on foot for taking up
vagrant boys and girls that lay begging in the streets
of the city, having neither home nor friends, and
transporting them to Virginia to be there industriously
employed. The scheme came before the Court of
Common Council on the 31st July in the form of a
petition from a number of citizens. A committee
was at once appointed to consider the matter, and
on the 24th September they brought in their report.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 30, fos. 374b, 396.</p></note>
The Virginia Company had agreed to take 100 boys<pb n="053" /><anchor id="Pg053" />
and girls between the ages of eight and sixteen, and
to educate and bring them up at the company's
charge. The company were prepared, moreover,
to give each boy and girl fifty acres of land, to each
boy as soon as he was twenty-four years of age, and
to each girl at the age of twenty-one or her marriage,
whichever should first happen. The charge of fitting
out and transporting that number was estimated at
£500, which sum the court agreed should be levied
on the inhabitants of the city rateably according as
each was assessed towards the last poor rate. The
young emigrants were soon afterwards shipped to their
new home,<note place="foot"><p>Chamberlain, writing to Carleton under date the 14th Oct.,
mentions the fact of the City shipping to Virginia 100 boys and girls
who were starving in the streets.—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1611-1618),
p. 584.</p></note> and so successfully did the undertaking
turn out that in little over a year another application
was made to the Common Council (18 Dec., 1619)
for another batch of 100 children for shipment to
the colony in the following spring.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 31, fo. 122 (125).</p></note> It was desired
that the new emigrants should be twelve years old
and upwards, with an allowance of £3 apiece for
their transportation and 40<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> apiece for their apparel,
"as was formerly graunted." The boys would be
put out as apprentices until the age of twenty-one,
and the girls likewise until the same age or marriage,
after which they would be placed as tenants on the
public lands, and be furnished with houses, stock of
corn and cattle to begin with, and afterwards enjoy
the moiety of all increase and profit. The Common
Council being desirous of forwarding "soe worthy
and pious a worke" as the plantation, accepted<pb n="054" /><anchor id="Pg054" />
the company's proposal, and directed that a sum
of £500 necessary for the purpose should be levied
as on the previous occasion.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Disagreement between the City and the Virginia Company.</p></note>

<p>Some hitch, however, appears to have occurred in
connection with the shipment of this second consignment
of children. The City and the Virginia Company
had fallen out for some reason or other. In a letter
written about this time to the lord mayor<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, v, 56 (Analytical Index, p. 362).</p></note> the
company express regret that differences should have
arisen between the city and themselves. They assure
his lordship that there was no real foundation for
these differences, seeing that they had now ratified
all, and more than all than had been previously
offered and accepted. Everything had been done
that was necessary for the shipment of the children.
The City had collected the requisite funds and the
children had been provided, whilst the company on
its part had provided a fair ship, and the Privy
Council had "at the city's desire" granted its warrant.<note place="foot"><p>The company appears to have applied through Sir Edwin Sandys,
its new treasurer, for a warrant to "enforce" the transportation of the
hundred children to be sent to Virginia at the City's expense, 28 Jan.,

The company therefore trusted that the lord
mayor and aldermen would proceed to the speedy
ending of differences.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Loafers about the court transported to Virginia. 1619.</p></note>

<p>The number of emigrants to Virginia was swelled
by the transportation of a number of idle fellows who
made it their business to follow the king and his
court wherever they might happen to be. Early in
1619, when the king was at Newmarket, he took
occasion to write to Sir Thomas Smith complaining
of the annoyance and desired that they might be<pb n="055" /><anchor id="Pg055" />
sent to Virginia at the next opportunity.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, v, 8 (Analytical Index, p. 361).</p></note> Immediately
on the receipt of this letter Sir Thomas
Smith wrote to Sir Sebastian Hervey, the mayor,
forwarding at the same time the king's letter, and
asking that the batch of idle court loafers which
had already been despatched from Newmarket to
London, as well as those to follow, might be lodged
for a time in Bridewell, and there set to work until
such time as there should be a vessel starting for the
colony.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, v, 9.</p></note></p>

<p>The Virginia colony—the first of the free colonies
of England—soon became firmly established, and the
City of London can claim to have had no small share
in the work of its establishment. To the enterprising
spirit shown by the citizens in their efforts to forward
the interests of the colony no better testimony is
wanted than a thanksgiving sermon<note place="foot"><p>The sermon is reproduced in "Memoir of Rev. Patrick Copland,"
by Edward D. Neill (New York, 1871), chap. iii.</p></note> preached (18 April,
1622) in the church of St. Mary-le-Bow by Patrick
Copland, chaplain to the Virginia Company, in commemoration
of the safe arrival of a fleet of nine ships
at the close of the previous year. The City of
London, the preacher said, had on two occasions sent
over 100 persons to Virginia, and the present lord
mayor and his brethren the aldermen intended to
pursue the same course as previous mayors. "Your
cittie," he continued, "aboundeth in people (and long
may it doe so); the plantation in Virginia is capable
enough to receive them. O, take course to ease
your cittie, and to provide well for your people, by<pb n="056" /><anchor id="Pg056" />
sending them over thither, that both they of that
colony there and they of your owne cittie here may
live to bless your prudent and provident government
over them.... Right Worshipfull, I beseech you
ponder (as I know you doe) the forlorne estate of
many of the best members of your citty, and helpe
them, O helpe them out of their misery; what you
bestow uppon them in their transportation to Virginia
they will repay it at present with their prayers, and
when they are able with their purses."<note place="foot"><p>This prophecy was literally fulfilled by the gift of half a million of
money for the relief of the poor of London by the late George Peabody,
himself a descendant of an emigrant to North Virginia.</p></note></p>

<p>A few months after this sermon had been delivered
tidings reached England of a calamity more disastrous
than any that had yet befallen the colony. A
treacherous attack had been made upon the white men
by the Indians, which was only just saved by timely
notice from becoming a general massacre. As it was,
nearly 350 of the settlers were killed. The Common
Council lost no time in testifying its sympathy with
the colony in the great loss it had sustained, and
voted (19 July) a third sum of £500 towards the
transportation of 100 fresh colonists.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 32, fo. 66.</p></note></p>

<p>In the meanwhile James had applied to the City
(April, 1610) for a loan of £100,000. He professed
to prefer borrowing the money from the citizens to
raising it by privy seals from his subjects generally,
and he promised interest at the rate of ten per cent.
and security on the customs. The aldermen consented
to raise the money "out of aboundance of love ...
but not of aboundance of riches or meanes." They
and the Recorder divided themselves into nine several
companies or divisions, each bound to furnish one-ninth
of the whole loan. The king gave his own bond in
£150,000 besides bonds of the farmer of the customs
as security, and the aldermen set to work to raise the
money in as "secret and discreet manner" as they
could.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 29, fos. 207-209b, 220, 225.</p></note> The loan did not go far towards discharging
the king's liabilities, or those of the late queen, whose
debts James had undertaken to repay. Before the
end of the year (1610) certain wealthy merchants of
the city were summoned to Whitehall to discuss the
state of affairs. The king again wanted money, but
inasmuch as he confessed himself unable to do more
than pay the interest on former loans, leaving the
principal to be discharged at some future time, they
refused to make any further advances, consenting
only not to press for the repayment of outstanding<pb n="058" /><anchor id="Pg058" />

Murderess and adulteress as she was, she was

had been aggravated by recent court festivities, at
length drove James to run the risk of summoning
another parliament. He had learnt from the wire-pullers
of the day—or "undertakers" as they were
then called—that he could depend upon a majority
being returned which would be willing to grant supplies
in return for certain concessions.  In this he
was deceived. No sooner did constituents discover
that pressure was being brought to bear in favour
of court candidates than they used their best efforts
to frustrate such a manifest design to pack parliament.
The session was opened on the 5th of April
by a speech from the king, in which he set forth
his financial difficulties, which the extraordinary
charge in connection with his daughter's marriage
had helped to increase. He would not bargain for
their money, he said, but would leave it entirely
to their love what supplies should be granted. In
token of his own affection towards his subjects
he was ready to make certain concessions, and
he entirely disavowed any complicity with the
"strange kind of beasts called undertakers." The
new parliament, however, stood out like the last
and refused to grant supplies until public grievances
had been considered. The result was that on the
7th June James dissolved what he had fondly
hoped would have proved to be a "parliament of
love," but which from its inability to pass a single<pb n="063" /><anchor id="Pg063" />

Their lordships had been informed that the city
was altogether unprovided with arms and could not
furnish the full number of trained men with weapons
at one and the same time, and that there was scarce
sufficient match and powder in the whole city to
serve for one day's training. They expressed astonishment
that the civic authorities, in whom was vested
the government of the king's Chamber, should have
proved so negligent in a matter so important, and
directed them to set up forthwith a magazine of arms
for supplying not only the inhabitants of the city,
but also those of adjacent counties, with military
weapons, and to supply themselves with a store
of gunpowder of not less than 100 lasts, by the aid<pb n="067" /><anchor id="Pg067" />

company of Merchant Adventurers and the formation
of a new company. For these measures the king was
not so much to blame as William Cockaine, the city
alderman who gave him advice on the matter. That
the advice was bad became soon manifest. The Dutch,
who had been the principal buyers of English undyed
cloth, retaliated by setting up looms for themselves,
and threatened to destroy the English cloth trade
altogether. The new company, with Cockaine at its
head, proved a complete failure, and the old company

he said, required just then "the present use of good
somes of money," by way of a loan, and he could
think of no better way of supplying himself than by
resorting, as his forefathers had done, "to the love"
of his city, and borrowing the money upon the credit
of its common bonds. He reminded them that
whenever he had borrowed money the lenders had
always received "royall paiement," and he doubted
not that they would now act as their own registers
and records would show that their predecessors had
acted on similar occasions. On the 22nd January this
application was read to the Common Council, when,
after mature deliberation, it was unanimously agreed—"without
either word or hand to the contrary"—that
one or more bonds should be made in the name of the
Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of London,
under their common seal, for the repayment of
principal, together with interest, to those who were
willing to contribute towards the loan, upon such
counter security as was mentioned in the king's
letter. The security there mentioned was to be under
the great seal and of such a character as the city had<pb n="071" /><anchor id="Pg071" />
been accustomed formerly to receive from the king's
predecessors. It appears that James had a few days
before endeavoured to get the citizens to advance the
sum of £100,000 on the security of the crown jewels,
but this proposal had met with little favour.<note place="foot"><p>Cal. State Papers Dom. (1611-1618), p. 428. He contrived,

especially intended for the purpose, and to lay the
burden of contribution upon persons of weak and mean

publicly declared that he would rather that he and his
daughter were both dead than that he should give his
consent. The king pressed matters so far as one day

dinner at Merchant Taylors' Hall, in order to urge
upon them the marriage.<note place="foot"><p>Chamberlain to Carleton, 15 July, 1619.—"Court and Times,"

the strained relations existing at the time between
the king and the mayor that the civic authorities
were not invited to the funeral of the queen. If
that be the case James soon saw that he had made a
mistake, and in order "to please them" caused a

Matthias, and in the following year they deposed his
successor, Ferdinand, after unceremoniously flinging
his deputies out of the window, and offered the crown
to Frederick, the Elector Palatine, who had married
James's daughter, the Princess Elizabeth. The
Elector asked his father-in-law's advice before accepting
the proffered crown, but James shilly-shallied
so long that Frederick could wait no longer,
and he signified his acceptance (26 Aug., 1619).
James was urged to lend assistance to his son-in-law

<p>When parliament at length met (after several
prorogations) on the 30th January (1621) James
opened the session with a long speech, in which a
request for supplies held a prominent place. The
Commons, however, without showing any disposition
to be captious, were in no hurry to grant war supplies
until they were assured that there was to be a war.<pb n="079" /><anchor id="Pg079" />
The king had therefore to be content with a grant of
no more than two subsidies, or about £160,000. He
had recently issued a proclamation (24 Dec., 1620)
forbidding his subjects to speak on affairs of State.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 31, fo. 264.</p></note>
If the nation in general was to be thus bridled the

own right to liberty of speech.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Spanish Ambassador ill-treated." /><note place="margin"><p>The citizens and the  Spanish ambassador.</p></note>

<p>There was also a class of Londoner not easily
silenced. A royal proclamation had no terrors for the
London apprentice; and when they recognised an
old enemy in the person of the Spanish ambassador<note place="foot"><p>The Spanish ambassador for the time being often fell foul of the
Londoners. In 1612 his hat with a valuable jewel in it was snatched
off his head amid the jeers of by-standers.—"Court and Times," i, 191,
192. In 1618 an attack was made on his house because one of his
suite had ridden over a child and nearly killed it. A commission sat
at the Guildhall to punish the offenders, but the mayor treated those
who had offered the insult to the ambassador with such leniency that
the king waxed wroth.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign>, ii, 81-82, 85, 86.</p></note>
in the street, they were accustomed to give tongue
and, if thwarted, to resort to blows. It happened one
day that as Gondomar was being carried down
Fenchurch Street, an apprentice standing idly with
one or two of his fellows at his master's door cried
out, "There goeth the devil in a dung-cart." This
remark raised a laugh which so stung one of the
ambassador's servants that he turned sharply on the
offender. "Sir," said he, "you shall see Bridewell
ere long for your mirth." "What," cried one of his
fellows, "shall we go to Bridewell for such a dog as
thou?" and forthwith brought him to the ground
with a box on the ear. The ambassador laid a
complaint before the mayor, who somewhat reluctantly
sentenced the offending apprentices to be whipt<pb n="080" /><anchor id="Pg080" />
at the cart's tail. That any of their number should be
flogged for insulting a Spaniard, even though he were
the Spanish king's ambassador, was intolerable to the
minds of the apprentices of London, who were known
for their staunchness to one another. The report
spread like wildfire, and soon a body of nearly 300
apprentices had assembled at Temple Bar, where they
rescued their comrades and beat the city marshals.
Again Gondomar complained to the mayor, who, sympathising
at heart with the delinquents, testily replied
that it was not to the Spanish ambassador that he
had to give an account of the government of the
city. The matter having reached the king's ears at
Theobalds, he suddenly appeared at the Guildhall
and threatened to place a garrison in the city and
to deprive the citizens of their charter if matters
were not mended. His anger was with difficulty
appeased by the Recorder, and he at last contented
himself with privately admonishing the aldermen to
see the young fellows punished. The end of the
affair was tragical enough. The original sentence
was carried out, with the result that one of the
apprentices unhappily died.<note place="foot"><p>Meddus to Mead, 6 April. [Dr. James Meddus was rector of St.

<p>Such is the account of the disturbance as found
in contemporary letters. From the City's records<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 35, fos. 141b, 142.</p></note> we
learn a few additional particulars. On Wednesday,
the 4th April, a special Court of Aldermen sat, at
which a letter from the lords of the council was read
signifying the king's pleasure that David Sampson,<pb n="081" /><anchor id="Pg081" />
an apprentice to a tailor, should be very sharply
whipt through the city from Aldgate to Fleet Street
by the common executioner for an insult offered
the Spanish ambassador on the preceding Monday
(2 April). A good guard was also to be appointed
for the purpose, and instructions were given to the
Recorder and some of the aldermen to discover if
possible the rest of the offenders. The result of their
efforts in this direction was the apprehension of
Robert Michell, an apprentice to a haberdasher, and
Richard Taylor, an apprentice to a bricklayer, the
former of whom was accused of threatening to throw
a loaf at the "choppes" of the ambassador's servant,
and the latter with having actually discharged a
brickbat with effect at one of his suite. Sampson's
whipping, which ought to have taken place in the
forenoon of Wednesday, was thereupon postponed
until the afternoon, when all three offenders were
punished together, in the presence of a good guard.
On the following morning (5 April) another special
Court of Aldermen sat at the mayor's own house,
when it was ordered that Daniel Ray, a drayman,
who had been convicted of holding up his hand
at the Spanish ambassador as he passed through
Gracechurch Street, grinning at him and calling him
"Spanish dogge" just before Michell and Taylor
committed their excesses, should also be whipt
between eight and nine o'clock the next morning.
In order to prevent a repetition of the disturbance
which had occurred the previous day, the mayor
issued his precept<note place="foot"><p>Journal 31, fo. 303.</p></note>(5 April) for a substantial double
watch to be kept for twenty-four hours from nine<pb n="082" /><anchor id="Pg082" />
o'clock in the evening of the 5th April. The inhabitants
were further ordered to stand at their doors,
halberd in hand, and ready for any emergency, whilst
they were to see that their apprentices, children and
servants behaved well towards all ambassadors and
strangers as well as his majesty's subjects.</p>

<p>By this time news of the confusion and rescue
attending the earlier punishment had reached the
king's ears. Ray's whipping was put off. The
Recorder informed the Court of Aldermen, specially
summoned to the mayor's house on Friday afternoon
(6 April), that the king purposed coming that
day to the Guildhall in person between two and three
o'clock, when the mayor and aldermen were commanded
to attend, and until then the execution of
Ray's punishment was not to be carried out. At the
appointed hour James arrived with divers lords of the
council. He is recorded<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 35, fo. 142b.</p></note> as having made an excellent
oration to the mayor and aldermen, "much reprovinge
their misgovernment, and the ill carriage of the rude
sorte of people, and the affront lately offered to justice
in that rescue." He commanded them at their
peril to see that no manner of affront occurred in the
punishment of Daniel Ray, but that he should after
his whipping be quietly conveyed to prison until his
majesty's pleasure should be further known. Three
days later (9 April) Ray, Sampson and Taylor
(Michell appears to have been the one who succumbed
to ill treatment) appeared before a special
Court of Aldermen and, acknowledging their offences,
asked pardon of God and the king. Thereupon the
Recorder signified to them the king's remission of<pb n="083" /><anchor id="Pg083" />
further punishment, and they were discharged out
of prison.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 35, fos. 142b, 143.</p></note></p>

<p>Whilst the Commons were chafing under the
restriction which forbade them mentioning even the
name of the Palatinate, an elderly individual named
Floyd was imprisoned in the Fleet for displaying joy
at the news of the battle of Prague. "Goodman
Palsgrave and Goodwife Palsgrave," he had been
heard to say, "were now turned out of doors." All
sorts of punishment was suggested by members of
the House, which after all had no jurisdiction in the
matter whatever; and after a kind of three-cornered
duel between the king, the Lords and Commons,
Floyd was made to expiate his crime by riding from
Fleet Bridge to the Standard in Cheapside, his face
towards the horse's tail, and having a paper in his
hat with the words, "For using ignominious and
malicious words against the Prince and Princess
Palatine, the king's only daughter and children."
After standing there for two hours he was branded
on his forehead with the letter K and conveyed to
the Fleet.<note place="foot"><p>"Court and Times," ii, 256; Gardiner, ii, 14.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City asked to advance £20,000 on security of subsidy, March, 1621.</p></note>

<p>The Commons having voted supplies, albeit small
and inadequate for the king's wants, James lost no
time in asking the citizens for an advance on the
amount of subsidy due from them. On the 27th
March (1621) the lord treasurer wrote very urgently
on the matter. "I pray you," he added by way of
postscript, "make noe stickinge hereatt; you shall
bee sure to bee paid att the tyme named."<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, v, 103 (Index, p. 413).</p></note> If the<pb n="084" /><anchor id="Pg084" />
citizens could not advance the whole sum at short
notice, they were asked to give credit for the rest
to the merchant whom Baron Dohna should appoint
for transferring the money to the Palatinate by
bills of exchange. It was all to no purpose. The
mayor and aldermen were tired of the repeated
calls upon their purse, and returned answer by word
of mouth of the Common Sergeant and the Remembrancer
that the City hoped rather to receive
part of the money already lent than to "runne in
further."<note place="foot"><p>Marginal note to the lord treasurer's letter.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="The City and the Spanish Match." /><note place="margin"><p>Joy in the city at the return of Charles from Spain, Oct., 1623.</p></note>

<p>The failure of negotiations for a Spanish match,
and the return of Prince Charles after his romantic
expedition in 1623 without bringing the Infanta with
him, was a source of great satisfaction both to the
City and the nation. The following story of the day
serves to illustrate the feeling prevalent at the time
relative to the Spanish match. The bishop of London
had given orders to the clergy, pursuant to instructions
he had himself received from James, not to "prejudicate
the prince's journey by their prayers," but
only to pray to God to bring him safely home again
and no more. A clergyman, who must have been a
bit of a wag (for it is difficult to explain his conduct
otherwise), is said to have literally carried out his
bishop's orders, and to have prayed publicly "That
God would return our noble prince home again to us
and no more."<note place="foot"><p>Mead to Stuteville, 29 March, 1623. The writer of this letter
appears to have lost the point of the jest, and ascribes the circumstance
to the pure simplicity of the clergyman, who mistook the nature of the
order.—"Court and Times," ii, 381.</p></note> When it became known that the
prince had arrived safely at Madrid, bonfires were<pb n="085" /><anchor id="Pg085" />
lighted and bells rung; but the Londoners were but
half-hearted in expressing their joy, and would probably
have made no display had they not received
orders from the lords of the council.<note place="foot"><p>Chamberlain to Carleton, 5 April, 1623; Mead to Stuteville,
5 April, 1623.—"Court and Times," ii, 383-385.</p></note> It was otherwise
when the prince returned—and without the
Infanta. As soon as news reached the mayor that
Charles had arrived at Guildford he issued his precept
(6 Oct.) for bells to be rung and bonfires to
be lighted,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 32, fo. 222.</p></note> and right gladly were his orders carried
out. "I have not heard of more demonstrations of
public joy than were here and everywhere, from
the highest to the lowest," wrote Chamberlain from
London;<note place="foot"><p>Chamberlain to Carleton, 11 Oct., 1623.—"Court and Times,"
ii, 422.</p></note> "such spreading of tables in the streets
with all manner of provisions, setting out whole
hogsheads of wine and butts of sack, but specially
such numbers of bonfires, both here and all along as
he [the prince] went, the marks whereof we found
by the way two days afterwards, is almost incredible."</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The parliament of 1624.</p></note>

<p>The king's foreign policy having proved a total
failure, there was no other course open for him but to
summon a parliament. A parliament was accordingly
summoned to meet in February of the next year
(1624). The king and Commons soon found themselves
in opposition, the former advocating a war in
Germany for the defence of the Palatinate, the latter
a war against Spain. At length a compromise was
effected, the Commons agreeing to vote supplies on
the understanding that James broke off all negotiations
with Spain.</p>

<pb n="086" /><anchor id="Pg086" />

<note place="margin"><p>The French alliance.</p></note>

<p>Negotiations with Spain were thereupon broken
off, but not before James had found another ally in
France. Before parliament was prorogued (29 May)
James had sounded Louis XIII as to a marriage
between Charles and Henrietta Maria, the French
king's sister. In April Count Mansfeld, a German
adventurer who had offered his services to France,
arrived in England and was hospitably entertained.
The object of his visit was to see the extent of the
preparations that were being made for war.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Efforts made to raise money in the city, July, 1624.</p></note>

<p>Strenuous efforts to raise money in the city were
made. Chamberlain, writing to Carleton from London
(1 July), tells his friend, "Here is great expedition
used to raise money, and make ready payment;
insomuch that since Monday sevennight, the council
have sat thrice at Guildhall about the subsidies."
The lord keeper, in his endeavours to persuade the
citizens to loosen their purse-strings, went so far as to
declare that anyone disguising his wealth was
committing the sin against the Holy Ghost, and was
as Ananias and Saphira! So great was the general
decay, both in the city and the country, that there
was some talk of putting in force the penal laws
against recusants, notwithstanding the negotiations
that were going on for a French marriage, in order to
make up the expected deficit.<note place="foot"><p>"Court and Times," ii, 463-464.</p></note> The civic authorities
were again pressing the king for the repayment
of the loan (£100,000) made in 1617. Time had
wrought alterations in the condition of the lenders;
some were dead and their widows and orphans
were crying out for repayment; some were decayed
and imprisoned, and others likely to undergo the<pb n="087" /><anchor id="Pg087" />
same calamity if steps were not taken for their
speedy relief. They complained that the city's seal,
which had by his majesty's command been given as
security to the tenders, suffered as never it had done
before, and several suits had been commenced against
the Chamber of London in the courts at Westminster,
to which they knew not how to give satisfactory
answer. They therefore prayed him to give order
for such payment to be made to them as might give
relief to the distressed and comfort to them all. The
result was that the king directed (July, 1624) his
two principal secretaries and the chancellor of the
exchequer to devise means for satisfying the debt.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vi, 125 (Index, pp. 195-196).</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Mansfeld in London, Sept., 1624.</p></note>

<p>In September Mansfield was again in England
asking for men and money for the recovery of the
Palatinate, in which he had been assured of the
co-operation of France. This assurance, however,
was only a verbal one, and nothing would induce
Louis to reduce it to writing. James on his part was
willing to make every concession, provided that the
matrimonial alliance on which he had set his heart
could be brought to a happy conclusion. But as these
concessions involved broken pledges, he feared to face
the Commons, and thus the parliament, which should
have re-assembled this autumn, was further prorogued
and never met again until James was no more.</p>

<p>It was to James's last parliament that the City
was indebted for a statute,<note place="foot"><p>An Act for the general quiet of the subjects against all pretences
of concealment whatsoever.—Stat. 21, James I, c. 2.</p></note> which at length insured
it quiet enjoyment of its lands free from that inquisitorial
system which had prevailed since 1547, under<pb n="088" /><anchor id="Pg088" />
pretext that it had concealed lands charged with
superstitious uses which had not been redeemed. In
1618 a commission had been appointed to enquire as
to the waste grounds of the city, on pretence of
concealment; but upon representation being made by
the mayor and aldermen that the City had long
enjoyed the lands in question by ancient grant, proceedings
had been stayed.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, iv, 126 (Index, p. 115).</p></note> Early in the following year
(1619), however, the livery companies were called

by the king.<note place="foot"><p>Cal. State Papers Dom. (1619-1623), pp. 4-5.</p></note> On learning that this money was to

(Index, p. 116).</p></note> the mayor and aldermen petitioned the
king for a grant of letters patent, securing both for
the City and the companies quiet enjoyment of their
possessions, lest in that "searching age" other defects
might haply be found in their title, to be followed
by further inconveniences. To this the king readily
assented, and instructed the attorney-general to draw
up letters patent embracing such matters as the City
desired.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, v, 82 (Index, p. 116).</p></note> The letters patent were no sooner drawn

<p>The question how to supply Mansfield with men
as well as money necessary for his undertaking in the
absence of parliament was answered by making
application to the Council of War. On the 29th
October orders were issued for pressing 12,000 men
for the service, and on the same day James himself
wrote to the mayor for 2,000 men to be pressed in
the city to assist in the recovery of the Palatinate.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vi, 67.</p></note>
Two days afterwards (31 Oct.) followed a letter from
the lords of the council<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vi, 68; Journal 32, fo. 330.</p></note> directing the mayor to see
that the men were of able bodies and years, but
not taken out of the trained bands, which were to
be left entire. They were to be ready by the end of
November to march to Dover under such officers as
the Privy Council might select. As the amount of
conduct money, which was usually a half-penny per
mile, would vary owing to the difference of localities
where the men lived, it was thought best to allow
them their ordinary pay of eightpence per day from<pb n="090" /><anchor id="Pg090" />
the time they were handed over to the officers. The
mayor was further directed to demand of the collectors
of the subsidy sufficient money for the charge of coats,
conduct, armour, etc. On the last day of November
the lords of the council wrote again informing the
lord mayor of the names of the officers appointed to
conduct the men to Dover by the 24th December.
He was to see that the men were delivered to the
officers by roll indented, to be subscribed by himself
or his deputy-lieutenants on the one part and the

on the night of the 18th December or by the next
morning at the latest, in order to set out on their march

promises of the French king proved fallacious and
Mansfeld was forbidden to land his forces in France.
This prohibition, however, was little to him, for he
had already determined to act in direct opposition to
the wishes of James and to carry his army to
Flushing. Before he set sail from Dover, which he
did on the 31st January (1625), it became necessary
to recruit his rapidly diminishing forces by the issue
of new press warrants. The City was called upon to

supplied.<note place="foot"><p>"There is a warrant for a new press here of 2,000 men, the

<index index="toc" level1="A loan of £60,000 to Charles I." /><note place="margin"><p>A city loan of £60,000 to King Charles, 1625.</p></note>

<p>The commencement of the reign of Charles I,
like his father's, was marked by a recurrence of the
plague, which greatly affected the trade of the city.
Matters were made worse by an application from the
Lord High Treasurer for a loan of £60,000 to the
king within a few weeks of Charles ascending the
throne. He promised that the money, which was
wanted for fitting out the fleet which the late king
was busy preparing at the time of his death, should
be repaid in six months. Interest would be allowed
at the rate of eight per cent., and Charles would
give mortgage security for repayment of this as well
as of the sum of £100,000 borrowed by James.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fo. 85b.</p></note>
After mature deliberation the Common Council agreed
(16 April) to accede to the Lord Treasurer's request,
and appointed two representatives of each ward to
consult with the mayor and aldermen as to the mode
of raising the amount, as well as to consider the
nature of the security offered. On the 20th May
the Common Council received the committee's report
on the matter.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 105.</p></note> It recommended that the money
should be borrowed and taken up by twenty aldermen
and one hundred commoners nominated for the
purpose; that five commoners should be allotted to
each alderman, and that they should stand bound for<pb n="093" /><anchor id="Pg093" />
the sum of £3,000. Any alderman or commoner
refusing to be so joined was to be forced to lend
£1,000 on his own account. The assurance of the
king's lands was to be made in the names of such
aldermen and commoners as the Court of Aldermen
should appoint. A week later (27 May) the Court of
Aldermen, in anticipation of the money being raised,
ordered an advance to be made to the king out of the
City's Chamber of the sum of £14,000.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 39, fo. 226b.</p></note> On the 2nd
June the king's mortgage was executed;<note place="foot"><p>Journal 37, fos. 367-390b.</p></note> and there
being no longer any necessity for keeping the bonds
entered into by various aldermen for the payment of
interest due to contributors to the loan of £100,000,
they were ordered to be cancelled.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 39, fo. 243b.</p></note> In November
the lords of the council wrote to the City for an
extension of time for the repayment of the £60,000.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vi, 78 (Index, p. 194).</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Arrival of Henrietta Maria in London, June, 1625.</p></note>

<p>On the 1st May Charles was married by proxy at
Paris to Henrietta Maria. When the news of the
marriage treaty between England and France reached
London in the previous November the citizens showed
their joy by bonfires and fireworks.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fo. 6.</p></note> They forgot for
a while the danger likely to arise from the heir to the
throne allying himself in marriage with a Catholic

whither—fired such a salute as the queen had never
heard before.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fo. 129; Meddus to Mead, 17 June, 1625.—"Court

<p>In the meantime (1 May) Charles had issued his
warrant to the lord mayor for levying 1,000 men—"part
of 10,000 to be raised by our dear father's
gracious purpose, according to the advice of both his
Houses of Parliament, in contemplation of the distress
and necessity of our dear brother and sister."<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia (Index, p. 255); Chamberlain to Carleton, 14 May.—Cal.
State Papers Dom. (1624-1626).</p></note> He
thought that if he could only gain a victory it would
serve to draw a veil over his delinquencies. The City
was to be assisted by the county of Middlesex in raising
the men,<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, viii, 74 (Index, p. 255).</p></note> and an allowance was made for "coat
and conduct money" for the soldiers at the rate
of eightpence apiece per day for their journey to
Plymouth, the place where they were to embark
(£400), and four shillings a coat (£200), the pay of
a captain being four shillings a day.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vi, 108 (Index, pp. 251-252).</p></note> The mayor's
precept to the aldermen to raise the men enjoined
them to search all inns, taverns, alehouses, "tabling-houses"
and tobacco-houses, and to press, especially,
all "tapsters, ostlers, chamberlains, vagrants, idle and
suspected persons."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fo. 98b.</p></note> By August the condition of
the troops at Plymouth was pitiable. No money was
forthcoming for wages, and the soldiers were forced to
forage for themselves in the neighbouring country.
At last the fleet set sail (8 Oct., 1625). Its destination
proved to be Cadiz, whither it was despatched
in the hope of securing West Indian treasure on its
way home. The expedition, however, turned out to
be as complete a failure as that under Mansfeld in the
previous year.</p>

<pb n="095" /><anchor id="Pg095" />

<note place="margin"><p>The plague of 1625.</p></note>

<p>The citizen soldiers returned to find their city
almost deserted owing to the ravages of the plague.
In July the sickness had been so great as to necessitate
the adjournment of parliament to Oxford.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fo. 130b.</p></note> The colder
weather, as winter approached, appears to have made
but little difference. Dr. Donne, the Dean of St.
Paul's, estimated that in November there died a
thousand a day in the city of London and within the
circuit of a mile. "The citizens fled away as out of a
house on fire," he writes,<note place="foot"><p>Dr. Donne to Sir Thomas Roe, 25 Nov., 1625.—Cal. State Papers
Dom. (1625-1626), p. 158.</p></note> they "stuffed their pockets
with their best ware and threw themselves into the
highways, and were not received so much as into
barns, and perished so, some of them with more
money about them than would have bought the
village where they died." Donne himself removed
to Chelsea, but the infection even there became so
great that "it was no good manners to go to any
other place," and Donne therefore did not go to court.
As early as September the want and misery in the
city was described as being the greatest that ever any
man living knew: "No trading at all, the rich all
gone, house-keepers and apprentices of manual
trades begging in the streets, and that in such a
lamentable manner as will make the strongest heart
to yearn."<note place="foot"><p>Mead to Stuteville, 10 Sept., 1625.—"Court and Times," i, 46.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City called upon to furnish five ships for the defense of the river, Jan. 1626.</p></note>

<p>The new year brought relief, and Sunday, the
29th Jan. (1626) was appointed a solemn day of
thanksgiving to Almighty God for his mercy in
"stayinge his hand."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fo. 168b.</p></note> The civic authorities, however,<pb n="096" /><anchor id="Pg096" />
were scarcely rid of one trouble before they found
others springing up. Towards the close of the last
year a committee had been appointed by the Court
of Aldermen to devise measures for relieving the City
from the burden of supplying military arms and
"other like services" such as they had recently been
called upon to perform.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 40, fo. 38.</p></note> The committee had not
been long appointed before the City was called upon
to look to its stock of gunpowder, prepare the trained
bands,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fos. 159, 162b.</p></note> and furnish the king with five ships towards
protecting the river. This last demand was made on
the ground that they had furnished vessels for the
same purpose in the reign of Elizabeth.<note place="foot"><p>Lords of the council to the mayor, 23 Jan., 1626.—Remembrancia,

40, fo. 78b.</p></note> The Court
of Aldermen objected. Times were changed since
Elizabeth's day, the lords of the council were informed
in reply; the galleys then furnished by the City were
only wanted for a short time and when the country
was threatened with an invasion; but even then considerable
difficulty was experienced before the Common
Council passed an Act for supplying the vessels.
At the present time, when the City was in a far worse
condition than then, there was little or no hope of a
similar Act being passed.<note place="foot"><p>The mayor and aldermen to the lords of the council, 13 Feb.,

<p>The disastrous expedition to Cadiz increased the

the necessary writs. The enforcement of the recusancy<pb n="097" /><anchor id="Pg097" />

had in the meantime been carried out, and fresh proclamations

was not a whit more inclined to subject its
ancient privileges to the control of the Crown than
its predecessor had been. Buckingham himself, the
king's bosom friend and most trusted adviser, was
impeached; and the Commons declined to vote supplies
until they had presented their grievances to the
king and received his majesty's answer. This was
more than Charles could stand. He summoned them
to Whitehall and commanded them to cancel the
condition. He would give them "liberty of counsel,
not of control." To the urgent entreaty of the Peers
that he would grant a short respite he replied, "Not
a minute," and on the 15th June the parliament of
1626 was dissolved.<note place="foot"><p>"Court and Times," i, 111-113.</p></note></p>

<p>If the war was to go on it was necessary that

Application was made to the City by the lords of the
council, at first verbally, afterwards by letter, for a loan

the effect that the City was unable to advance the
sum required, and it occasioned no little disappointment
to the king, who referred the matter back to
the mayor and aldermen once more. It was not that
Charles had not offered sufficient security for the loan.
The money could not be raised. At length it was
agreed (30 June) at another special court that the
aldermen themselves should advance the sum of
£20,000 for one year on the security of the petty
customs.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 40, fo. 278b. "London has lent the king £25,000

To the second the mayor was instructed to reply to
the following effect, viz.—that (1) the City was ready
to share with the rest of his majesty's subjects in a
matter which touched the state and defence of the
whole kingdom; (2) that inasmuch as the City had
been called upon in 1588, when the enemy was upon
the coast, to furnish only ten ships, and that each of
the twenty ships now demanded would, from its
larger burden, cost treble the amount of the former
ships, the citizens humbly desired to be relieved of so
great a charge, in respect of the city's decay in trade
and commerce, and its impoverishment by the late
visitation and otherwise; (3) that the ships could not
be furnished and victualled in the time named; (4) that
the city merchants would be the more willing to
adventure their lives and means against the enemy if
they were allowed letters of mark.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 33, fo. 280. Letter to Mead, 11 Aug.—"Court and

<p>The Lords expressed the greatest dissatisfaction

<p>Having failed to raise the necessary supplies by a

himself to a forced loan. The sum to be raised was
fixed at five subsidies. Commissioners were appointed
in September, 1626, to summon before them all men
rated in the subsidy books. At first the scheme
was confined to the five counties nearest London.<pb n="101" /><anchor id="Pg101" />
Opposition was met by imprisonment. The City for
awhile was left untouched. It was unwise to try the
temper of the citizens too much. It was found that
the nearer the City the greater was the opposition
shown to the commissioners; and the inhabitants of
the Strand and the Savoy offered a more determined
resistance than those of the parish of St. Margaret,
Westminster, or St. Martin-in-the-Fields.<note place="foot"><p>Letter to Mead, 6 Oct., 1626.—"Court and Times," i, 154. It

necessary.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The loan declared illegal.</p></note>

<p>Just at a time when privy councillors were about
to set out for the more distant counties to collect the
subsidies the judges suddenly pronounced an unanimous

report of their decision quickly spread, and increased
the opposition of the country gentry, many of whom
were content to suffer imprisonment rather than yield

provided the ships were commanded by officers of the
City's choosing, and were sent to sea alone "to be at

<p>Early in July the balance of the second instalment
of £60,000 (part of the late loan of £120,000)
was due from the City, but Charles could not wait so
long. An expedition to Rochelle under the Earl of
Denbigh had recently proved a failure. Determined
not to give way, Charles sent orders to the earl to
refit his squadron and remain in England until the
whole available maritime force of the country could
be got ready to accompany him. Money must be
raised at once. Charles himself wrote to the mayor
and aldermen (30 June) stating that a sudden and
important occasion of the relief of Rochelle required
present succours, and directing them to find immediately
the sum of £20,000 out of the moneys due on
the last purchase of the Crown lands. If they had not
such a sum in hand they were to raise it on credit.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vi, 153 (Index, p. 197).</p></note>
This sum exactly represented the balance due from
the City to the king, and precepts had already been
issued to the livery companies for raising the amount.
Another precept was sent out immediately on receipt
of the king's letter, whilst other precepts were directed
to levying the subsidies granted by parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 34, fos. 279-280b.</p></note> The<pb n="108" /><anchor id="Pg108" />
fate of Rochelle was, in spite of every effort, soon to

hand of an assassin (23 Aug.) whilst engaged at Portsmouth
in superintending preparations for its relief, and
two months later (18 Oct.) the fortress was compelled
to capitulate.</p>

<p>In the meantime the question of the king's right
to claim Tonnage and Poundage for life had given
rise to so much opposition that Charles had occasion
more than once to prorogue parliament. Merchants
had refused to pay the dues, and their goods had
been seized. Recourse was thereupon had to the
Sheriffs' Court of the City, where the owners sued
out a replevin as for property illegally distrained.
Popular feeling was so much on the side of the merchants
that when parliament met Charles publicly
renounced all claim to tonnage and poundage as a
right. Nevertheless the contest continued, and the
feeling of both parties was embittered by mutual
provocation and by proceedings taken in the Star
Chamber against merchants for protecting their
property from these exactions. At length matters
reached such a crisis that Charles determined upon an
adjournment; but no sooner was the king's intention
divined than the Commons determined to put their
grievances into writing and to cause them to be read
by the Speaker, whom they forcibly detained in the
chair. Sir John Finch having refused to accede to
their request, resolutions condemning religious innovation,
as well as the levying of tonnage and poundage,
were hastily put and carried by acclamation, whilst
Black Rod was vainly endeavouring to gain admission
to the House with a message from the king. Before<pb n="109" /><anchor id="Pg109" />

Rochelle—and remained until 1631. It was followed
as usual by a great scarcity of provisions. The civic

<p>Five years had now elapsed since the dissolution
of the last parliament, during which time the country<pb n="112" /><anchor id="Pg112" />
had submitted to the personal government of Charles.
Matters might have continued on the same footing
for some time longer had not Charles conceived the
idea of claiming the sovereignty of the seas as a
pretext for raising a fleet. The difficulty then arose
as to how to equip a fleet without summoning a
parliament. It had been the custom ever since the
time of the Plantagenets to call upon maritime
towns to furnish ships ready manned for the defence
of the realm at a time of threatened invasion. This
custom had been rendered sufficiently elastic to
comprise the port of London, and the City had
frequently been called upon to furnish a contingent of
vessels in time of war. Occasionally a protest may
have been made against such demands, but they
were seldom, if ever, altogether refused. On the
20th October, 1634, writs were issued calling upon
the city of London and various port towns and
places along the coast to furnish a certain number
of ships of war, and to have them ready at Portsmouth
by the 1st March, 1635. In many cases it
was impossible to supply ships of the size required,
and in these the king offered to supply ships of his
own on condition that the port towns should equip
and man them. London was called upon to supply
seven ships varying in size from 300 to 900 tons, with
an equipment of from 150 to 350 men.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Search to be made for precedents, Nov., 1634.</p></note>

<p>The Court of Aldermen appointed (13 Nov.) a

and carried the question of the king's right to levy
ship money to the Court of King's Bench.  The
judges, however, refused to allow the question to be
argued. "There was a rule of law and a rule of
government"—said Justice Berkeley, scarce realising
the true import of his words—"and many things
which might not be done by the rule of law might be
done by the rule of government." Chambers was
again committed for contempt, but was afterwards
liberated from prison upon payment of the £10 at

too touching the Royal Contract, differences as
to the City's rights to estreated recognisances, as to
pretended encroachments and other matters. It was
felt that there would be no peace until some arrangement
could be made with Charles on all the matters
in question, and for this purpose a committee was
appointed in May, 1636, to see what could be done.
A schedule of "thinges desired by the cittie of
London" was drawn up, and an offer was made to the
king of the sum of £100,000, to be paid by annual
instalments of £20,000, if he would make the concessions
desired.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 37, fo. 202; Remembrancia, vii, 181 (Index, p. 64).</p></note> The king's commissioners, who
had the business in hand, refused the offer. They
informed the committee that not only would the City
have to surrender certain valuable fisheries and other
privileges in Ireland, as well as the castle of Culmore,
but it would have to provide an allowance of £5,000
to Sir Thomas Philips. Instead of £100,000 it would
have moreover to pay £120,000.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 37, fos. 257-258.</p></note> Negotiations continued
for two years. Eventually a compromise was

<note place="margin"><p>Other grievances of the City.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime Charles had given umbrage to
the City in other matters, more especially in the
measures he had taken for regulating trade and the
institution of corporate monopolies. An order restricting
the use of coaches and carts, and forbidding
anyone to keep a carriage unless he was also prepared
to keep four sufficient horses or geldings for
the king's service, weighed heavily upon the mayor
and aldermen of the city, who were for the most
part men advanced in years and whose duties carried
them a good deal abroad. They therefore petitioned
the king for an exception to be made in their
favour. The petition was granted, but only after long
delay.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vii, 171 (Index, p. 421); Journal 37, fo. 121.</p></note></p>

<p>The civic authorities were not better pleased with

created a new corporation which embraced all tradesmen
and artificers in the city and suburbs, and thus
threatened to be a formidable rival to the ancient
corporation.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, vii, 178, 191 (Index, pp. 227-229); Journal 37,

<note place="margin"><p>A third writ for ship money, Oct., 1636.</p></note>

<p>In the midst of a growing feeling of dissatisfaction
at the existing state of things, a third writ for ship
money appeared (9 Oct., 1636). It raised such a
storm of opposition in every quarter, however, that
Charles once more appealed to the judges for a formal
acknowledgment of his right. Their opinion proving<pb n="118" /><anchor id="Pg118" />
favourable,<note place="foot"><p>It was laid down that when the good and safety of the kingdom

of 700 tons.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 38, fo. 17; Repertory 52, fos. 19b, 83b.</p></note></p>

<p>In the following year, after Hampden's case had
been decided, Charles continued to levy ship money,
and the City was told to furnish a ship of 500 tons
(5 Nov., 1638). The cost was estimated at £1,000.
The usual precept was issued (26 Nov.) to the
alderman of each ward for the purpose of ascertaining
how best that sum could be raised.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 38, fo. 174.</p></note> The returns

him that the City was not in a position to fit out
another ship.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 53, fo. 81.</p></note> The money was eventually raised by

<p>In the meantime troubles had arisen in Scotland
through Charles's ill-advised and bigoted attempt to
impose upon his northern subjects a Book of Common
Prayer. By midsummer (1638) he was preparing for
war and would shortly be under the necessity of
applying to the city for money and men. It was
probably with this end in view that he granted
(18 Oct., 1638) to the citizens an ample inspeximus
charter, confirming to them their ancient privileges
and franchises. Negotiations for a new charter had<pb n="119" /><anchor id="Pg119" />
been going on since the preceding March<note place="foot"><p>Journal 38, fo. 104.</p></note> (if not

<note place="margin"><p>Disorders in Scotland, 1639.</p></note>

<p>At the opening of the new year (4 Jan., 1639)
Charles applied by letter under his hand to the City
for a liberal contribution and assistance towards
putting down the disorders in Scotland, notifying at
the same time the fact that he had called upon the
peers of the realm to attend in person at York by the
1st April. The letter was read to the court of
Common Council on the 12th February, but the
matter seemed of so great importance that further
consideration of it was adjourned to the 16th, when
it was agreed to issue a precept to the alderman of
each ward to take steps for raising a free and liberal
contribution.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, viii, 216 (Index, p. 256); Journal 38, fos. 208b-209b,

every effort of the aldermen, less than £5,000 was
got together. The aldermen were directed to renew
their efforts, but this only resulted in increasing the
amount by £200 or £220.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 229, 297.</p></note> The whole amount was
so small that it was contemptuously refused. At the
beginning of April Charles found himself at York
with an indifferent army, and with little prospect of
being in a position to maintain even that army beyond
a very limited period.</p>

their appearance they were told that the king
expected from them no less a sum than £100,000.
The war was, if possible, more unpopular in the city
than in the country. The memory of the recent
confiscation of their Irish estates had not been
obliterated from the minds of the citizens by the
subsequent grant of a charter. The mayor and
aldermen replied that it was impossible to find the
money. The council told them that it must be done,
one of the lords declaring that they ought to have
sold their chains and gowns before making such a
reply. They were ordered to appear once more on
the 12th June with a final answer.<note place="foot"><p>Gardiner, "Hist. of England (1637-1649)," i, 239, 240. No

<p>That the citizens were not indisposed to assist
the king, if left to themselves and not subjected
to threats and intimidation, is shown by the fact
that, in anticipation of the return of Charles from
the North, the Common Council voted him (31
July, 1639) the sum of £10,000 as a free gift in
consideration that the City had not contributed
anything to his majesty on his setting out, as had
been required, "albeit the counties and private personnes
both nobles and others had done the same."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 38, fo. 303.</p></note>
Even this small sum could not be raised without

<p>Before the close of the year (1639) the country
was agreeably surprised at the news that it was the
king's intention to summon a parliament. Parliament
opened on the 13th April (1640). Few of its members
could have served in the last parliament of eleven
years before, but although so long a time had elapsed
since the Commons had met, they had not forgotten
their old constitutional claims to have the country's
grievances redressed before proceeding to grant<pb n="122" /><anchor id="Pg122" />
supplies. An offer to relinquish ship money proved
insufficient, and after three weeks the "short
parliament" was dissolved (5 May, 1640).</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Attempt to force a City loan." /><note place="margin"><p>Attempt to force a city loan of £100,000, April-May, 1640.</p></note>

<p>For some days before parliament was dissolved
every effort had been made by the king to get the
mayor and aldermen to lend him £100,000. This
being found impossible, the mayor, Henry Garway, or
Garraway, was directed to make out a list of the
wealthiest commoners. After several attempts to
negotiate with the aldermen individually, they were
summoned to appear in a body on Sunday, the 11th
April. Charles himself then told them that his
necessity at the time was so great that he must
borrow £100,000 of the City; that he must not be
denied; the money he must have at once, as it
would benefit him more then than twenty subsidies
granted by parliament afterwards. After the king had
finished speaking the Lord Privy Seal<note place="foot"><p>Henry Montague, Earl of Manchester, who had been the City's
Recorder from 1603-1616.</p></note> addressed them,
setting forth that a similar sum had been advanced
by the City to King James; that he himself, being
Recorder at the time, had lent £3,000 towards it,
and that the money had been repaid with interest.
The City, he continued, was rather beholden to his
majesty for taking the money and repaying it with
interest, than the king beholden to the City for lending
it. He further instanced the case of the City having
lent King Henry III a sum of £100,000 rather than
allow that monarch to pledge his crown and jewels to
the merchants of the Steelyard, and it was truly
repaid. To this the aldermen were not permitted to<pb n="123" /><anchor id="Pg123" />
make any reply, but were sent away to advise together
how the sum should be raised.<note place="foot"><p>Rossingham to Conway, 14th April, 1640.—Cal. State Papers
Dom. (1640), pp. 31-32.</p></note></p>

<p>On Thursday, the 7th May, the mayor and
aldermen were again summoned before the council,
when they were told that, having failed to provide the
sum previously asked for, they would now have to
find £200,000. If the latter sum was not forthcoming
the king threatened to "have £300,000 of the city."
They were to come again on the following Sunday (10
May) and bring with them a list of the rich men of
the wards.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Four Aldermen committed to prison." /><note place="margin"><p>Four aldermen committed to prison, 1640.</p></note>

<p>On the day appointed they came, but brought
with them a petition to be excused making such a list
as that required. The excuse was not allowed.
Strafford is recorded as having lost his temper at the
obstinacy of the aldermen. "Sir," said he, addressing
the king, "you will never do good to these citizens of
London till you have made examples of some of the
aldermen," and recommended Charles, in his own
"thorough" way, to hang a few of them.<note place="foot"><p>Rushworth, State Trials, 586.</p></note> Charles
did not take the advice offered. He would have made,
however, the mayor resign his sword and collar then
and there but for the intercession of the bystanders,
and actually committed four of the aldermen to
prison, viz., Nicholas Rainton, John Gayre, Thomas
Soame and Thomas Atkins, for refusing to make a
list of those inhabitants of their respective wards who
were able to lend from £50 upwards.<note place="foot"><p>Rossingham to Conway, 12 May, 1640.—Cal. State Papers Dom.
(1640), p. 155.</p></note> One of them,
Alderman Soame, gave particular offence. "I was an<pb n="124" /><anchor id="Pg124" />
honest man whilst I was a commoner," he told the
king to his face, "and I would continue to be so now
I am an alderman." The other aldermen professed
their readiness to give in the names of the richer
citizens, but objected to rate them according to their
means.</p>

<p>Both Garway and Sir Thomas Gardiner, the
Recorder, favoured the king. The latter was particularly
anxious that the City should lend the £100,000
originally requested, and did his best to get the
money advanced. For his zeal on this occasion, and
for "other high crimes and misdemeanours," he was
afterwards (1642) impeached.<note place="foot"><p>Howell, State Trials, iv, 167-170.</p></note></p>

<p>The aldermen were not long kept in confinement.
Even before their committal the city was in a ferment,
and a placard had appeared posted up in the Exchange
inviting all who were lovers of liberty to assemble in
St. George's Fields in Southwark early on Monday
morning (11 May). Archbishop Laud was a special
object of hatred to the citizens, and against him the
mob directed their attack. As soon as the trained
bands, which kept order during the day, had retired
for the evening, the rabble marched to Lambeth.
Laud, however, had been warned in time, and had
made good his escape across the river to Whitehall.
The rioters finding themselves baulked of their prey
retired with threats of returning to burn down the
palace. For the next few days the city was under
martial law. A double watch was kept in its streets.
The companies looked to their store of powder and
match. A strict guard was kept over servants and<pb n="125" /><anchor id="Pg125" />
apprentices, and a warrant issued for raising 1,000
men of the trained bands, or as many more as the
lord mayor should think necessary "to suppress,
slay, kill, destroy and apprehend all such as should
be tumultuously assembled in or about Southwark,
Lambeth, Blackheath or elsewhere in parts adjacent."<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, viii, 229 (Index, p. 458); Journal 29, fos. 84b, 85.</p></note></p>

<p>Pending the negotiations for a loan, payment of
ship money had not been strictly enforced; but now
that threats and entreaties had failed to open the
purse-strings of the citizens Charles made a desperate
effort to exact ship money. On the 9th June, 1640,
the lord mayor and both the sheriffs were summoned
to attend the council to give an account
of the ship money due from the city. Why had it
not been paid in? The mayor replied that he had
sent his officers to collect, but few or none would
pay.<note place="foot"><p>The mayor had issued precepts to the aldermen for its collection
on 28 Nov., 1639, and 3 Jan., 1640.—Journal 39, fos. 13, 24.</p></note> Upon the king telling him that he should
have distrained, the mayor remarked that one of his
predecessors in office, Sir Edward Bromfield, was still
a defendant in a suit in the King's Bench brought
against him by Richard Chambers for acting in that
manner, and was likely to be cast. "No man," said
Charles peremptorily, "shall suffer for obeying my
commands." Thus encouraged the mayor himself<pb n="126" /><anchor id="Pg126" />
made a house-to-house visit the next day, accompanied
by the sheriffs, for the purpose of collecting
the money. Throughout the whole city, however,
only one man was found ready and willing to pay.
When the mayor ordered the sheriffs to distrain they
refused on the plea that it was the mayor's business,
not theirs. Entering a draper's shop the mayor
attempted to seize a piece of linen cloth; the owner
set about measuring it, and naming the price told the
mayor that if he persisted in taking it he should esteem
it a purchase and put it to his lordship's account.<note place="foot"><p>Rossingham to Viscount Conway, 16 June.—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1640), pp. 306, 307.</p></note></p>

<p>On the 19th July news arrived from the North

serious matter to the Londoners, as they would thereby
be cut off from their supply of coal. Charles took
advantage of this, writes Dr. Gardiner,<note place="foot"><p>"Hist. of England (1637-1649)," i, 396.</p></note> and sent
Lord Cottington and Sir Henry Vane to the Common

would hear nothing more of the project recently
promulgated of debasing the coinage, a project which,
if carried out, would have worked great mischief to
the London merchant and tradesman. "Leaving the
Common Council to discuss the demand, the privy
councillors amused themselves by strolling through
the Cloth Exchange at Blackwell Hall. The owners
of cloth gathered quickly round them. They hoped,
they said, that they were not to be compelled to sell
for copper goods for which sterling silver had been
paid. After a debate of an hour and a half Cottington
and Vane were re-admitted, to be informed that the

told that the money was not required for the purpose
of making war, but only to enable his majesty to make
the more honourable peace, sword in hand. It would
be used to pay off the soldiers and so prevent them
pillaging the country after disbandment. Each company
was assessed according to its wealth; but most of
the principal companies pleaded inability to subscribe
on the ground that the Londonderry plantation had
"consumed their stocks." It was believed at the time
that not a tenth part of the money would be raised.<note place="foot"><p>Rossingham to Conway, 4 Aug., 1640.—Cal. State Papers Dom.

<p>Six weeks or more elapsed. The king and nobles
were at York holding a council. The City had been
brought into a better humour by a confirmation of its
rights (5 Sept.) to tolls known as "package" and
"scavage," and a pardon for all past offences in daring
to exact such tolls.<note place="foot"><p>Charter (preserved at the Guildhall, Boxes 21 and 30).</p></note> The citizens were still better

with the prospect of a speedy conclusion of peace with
Scotland. Under these circumstances one last effort
was made to get them to advance the long-wished-for
loan of £200,000. Not only did the king and the
lords ride to the city, but the Earl of Manchester, the
Lord Chamberlain, Viscount Campden, and other lords
paid a personal visit to the Guildhall and used their
utmost powers to persuade the citizens to advance the
money. The money might be paid by two instalments
of £50,000 and one instalment of £100,000 between

to dinner with the lord mayor and there appointed
to have a Common Council that afternoon, amongst
which we mingled divers commoners that were not
of the Common Council, such as we knew well
affected and powerful in the city." We are not
surprised to learn that this action on the part of the
lords was strongly objected to as not being altogether
regular. The lords insisted, however, and they were
allowed to have their own way. "At three o'clock
that afternoon," the letter goes on to say, "we met at
Guildhall, sat with them in the Court of Common
Council, and according to our instructions acquainted
them with the proceedings of the Assembly of Peers,
and used the best rhetoric, which was plain remonstrance
of all the passages at York, not concealing the
admirable grace and freeness shown by your majesty
in this great council, to the infinite content of all the
Peers, nor the true affection shown to you by the
Peers." They first read the letter from the lords and
then that from his majesty. They feared lest some
words which his majesty had (falsely) been reported to
have uttered on the occasion of the late petition from
the City for a parliament might have an injurious effect,
so they had explained this and other matters, and the
Common Council appeared well satisfied. "We then
withdrew, that they before they rose might more
freely debate upon the way of raising the sum
desired, for we persuaded ourselves it would not be<pb n="130" /><anchor id="Pg130" />
denied." They were not disappointed. Before the
council rose it resolved to make application to the
livery companies, and a draft of a letter was prepared.
A copy of this letter the lords forwarded to his majesty.
In conclusion they assured the king of the great services
done in the matter, more particularly by Garway, the
out-going mayor, the Recorder, and the whole bench of
aldermen, and suggested the advisability of sending
them a letter of thanks. If the letter were addressed
to the whole commonalty so much the better. This
suggestion was carried out.<note place="foot"><p>The king to the mayor, etc., 8 Oct.—Remembrancia, viii, 232

that a cessation of arms, under certain conditions, was

<index index="toc" level1="Meeting of the Long Parliament." /><note place="margin"><p>Meeting of the Long Parliament, 3 Nov., 1640.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>Speaker Lenthall.</p></note>

<p>Parliament—the Long Parliament—met as promised
on the 3rd November, 1640. Charles had
intended to nominate Sir Thomas Gardiner, the
Recorder, a devoted adherent of the Crown, as Speaker
of the Commons; but since the days of Heneage Finch
the City had failed to return its Recorder to parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Between 1631, the year of Finch's death, and 1635, when Gardiner
was elected Recorder, there had been three other Recorders, viz.,
Edward Littleton, Robert Mason and Henry Calthorp, not one of
whom sat in parliament for the city.</p></note>
Charles was therefore obliged to look elsewhere.
His choice fell upon William Lenthall, who was
the first to realise the position of a Speaker in times
of political controversy, and who throughout his
career acted up to his famous dictum, that "he had
neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak, save as the
House was pleased to direct him."</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The City and the Earl of Strafford." /><note place="margin"><p>The City and the Earl of Strafford.</p></note>

<p>As soon as parliament met, Strafford, who was
only too conscious of his impending fate, determined
to take the bull by the horns, and to use every means
to induce the king to anticipate the blow by boldly
accusing the parliamentary leaders of treasonable
designs. His efforts were futile. Rightly or wrongly,
it was generally believed that he intended to establish
a military despotism in England, and that London was
to be brought into subjection. The way in which it was
all to be effected was even described by Cradock, one<pb n="133" /><anchor id="Pg133" />
of the city members, in a speech he made to the
House. It is certain that the citizens regarded him as
a deadly foe. They had not forgotten the advice he
gave to Charles respecting the aldermen, nor his
attempt to ruin their trade by depreciation of the
coinage. For weeks past the city had been in a
disordered state. On the 22nd October, the mob
having forced its way into the Court of High Commission,
some of the offenders were brought before
the mayor and aldermen sitting on a commission of
Oyer and Terminer; but the grand jury refused to
find a true bill. These abortive proceedings were
followed by a riot at St. Paul's.<note place="foot"><p>On the 3rd November the mayor issued his precept for steps to
be taken to prevent further mischief.—Journal 39, fo. 143.</p></note> Before the House
had been in session a fortnight Strafford was ordered
into custody.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Necessity of raising money, Nov., 1640.</p></note>

<p>The £50,000 which the City had advanced went
but a little way towards meeting the king's necessities.
The two armies in the north had to be paid, and
there was not the wherewithal to pay them. The
City was ready to lend a further sum of £25,000,
on condition that the Londonderry estate was
restored, the garrison in the Tower removed and
the ordnance dismounted from its walls. Unless
this were done, said Cradock, "such jealousies
would possess the city, it would hinder supply."<note place="foot"><p>Gardiner, "Hist. of England (1637-1649)," ii, 22, 23.</p></note>
Parliament agreed to the loan being repaid, as a first
charge, out of the £100,000 ordered to be raised for
the relief of the army and northern counties;<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, 2 Dec., ii, 43; Repertory 55, fo. 21.</p></note> and
the Common Council lost no time in preparing a petition<pb n="134" /><anchor id="Pg134" />
to parliament for the restoration of the Irish lands.<note place="foot"><p>7 Jan., 1641.—Journal 39, fo. 162.</p></note>
Nor was it only in their corporate capacity that
the citizens came forward to render pecuniary
assistance to the government. On the 21st November
Isaac Pennington, alderman of the ward of Bridge
Without, and one of the city's representatives in
parliament, announced to the House that his constituents
had subscribed £21,000 to the loan.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Alleged Popish plot, Nov., 1640.</p></note>

<p>The general feeling of distrust that prevailed was
heightened by an attack made upon a member of
the House who, in his capacity of a justice of peace,
had prepared a list of recusants, in pursuance of a
recent proclamation.<note place="foot"><p>"Proclamation ordering Popish recusants to repair to their homes,
and not to come to court or within ten miles of London without
special licence, 11 Nov., 1640.—Journal 39, fo. 147.</p></note> So great was the alarm among
the Commons that Pennington offered the House a
guard of three hundred citizens, and at first there was
a disposition to accept the alderman's offer, but in
course of time better counsel prevailed and the idea
was abandoned.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Impeachment of Archbishop Laud, Dec., 1640.</p></note>

<p>The tendency of the city towards Puritanism at
this time was very marked. On the 28th November
Prynne and Burton entered London, and their entry
was made one long triumphal procession. This
circumstance was specially noted by the royalist
writer Clarendon as a remarkable "instance of the
unruly and mutinous spirit of the City of London,"
which he is pleased to term "the sink of all the ill
humour of the Kingdom."<note place="foot"><p>"Hist. of the Rebellion" (ed. 1839), pp. 85, 86.</p></note> A fortnight later (11 Dec.)
a petition for church reform and the abolition of
episcopacy "root and branch" was presented to<pb n="135" /><anchor id="Pg135" />
parliament, signed by 15,000 Londoners.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 49.</p></note> The blow
was aimed at Laud, who was looked upon as the cause
of all the country's trouble. That day week (18 Dec.)
the archbishop was impeached.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Scottish Commissioners in the City." /><note place="margin"><p>The Scottish commissioners in the city.</p></note>

<p>When the meetings held at Ripon between
English and Scottish commissioners for the purpose of
negotiating a treaty ceased (Oct. 1640), it was on the
understanding that they were to be resumed in London.
The Scottish commissioners accordingly came south,
and were lodged in the city in a house adjacent to the
church of St. Antholin, where they were visited by a
large concourse of citizens and magnificently entertained.<note place="foot"><p>Clarendon, "Hist. of the Rebellion," p. 81.</p></note>
It was with no little satisfaction that the
success of the Scots had been watched by the majority
of the inhabitants of the city, and now that the
northern commissioners were in their midst the
citizens took the opportunity of showing them substantial
marks of favour.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>City loan of £60,000, Jan., 1641.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>Reprieve of Goodman, 22 Jan., 1641.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>Excitement in the city.</p></note>

<p>On the 12th January, 1641, the Scottish demands
were formally submitted to parliament, but they were
not taken into consideration until the 22nd. After
much debate it was agreed in general terms that a
"friendly assistance" should be given, leaving the
amount and the manner of collection for future consideration.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 71.</p></note>
In the meantime the Speaker, Lenthall,
had written (15 Jan.) to the mayor directing him to
summon a Common Hall for the purpose of raising a
loan of £60,000 required for the army, and the
Common Council had agreed (18 Jan.) that the
amount should be collected from the wards.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 167.</p></note> But<pb n="136" /><anchor id="Pg136" />
before this could be accomplished an incident occurred
which threatened to jeopardise the loan. This was
the reprieve of John Goodman, a Roman Catholic
priest, who had been condemned to death. The
morning after parliament had agreed to raise money
for the Scottish commissioners alderman Pennington
rose in the House and declared that, in consequence
of Goodman's reprieve and other suspicious circumstances,
the City had resolved to lend nothing.<note place="foot"><p>"These sessions a priest was condemned at Newgate whom the
king reprieved, whereupon the city absolutely refused to send in their
moneys. The issue of it will be that in a day or two the man will be
hanged and we shall have our money." Uvedale to Bradley, 25 Jan.,
1641.—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1637-1649), p. 432.</p></note> The
Lords as well as the Commons followed the initiative
of the alderman and made a joint demand for the
execution of the condemned priest. As he had often
done before, Charles again threw over the Catholics.
He announced his intention not to allow the increase
of Popery or superstition in the country; he would
forthwith issue a proclamation commanding Jesuits
and priests to leave the kingdom within a month, and
he was willing to submit the case of Goodman to the
decision of both Houses.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 167b.</p></note> Fortunately for Goodman,
the City and the Commons had higher game to fly at
in Strafford, and the humbler priest was allowed to
remain unmolested in prison.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Letters to the City from Speaker Lenthall." /><note place="margin"><p>Letters from Lenthall to the City touching the loan of £60,000, 6 and 19 Feb., 1641.</p></note>

<p>On the 6th February the Speaker addressed a
second letter to the mayor to the effect that the
money was required sooner than it could be collected
by way of subsidies, as formerly suggested to his
lordship, and that consequently the House had
directed him to take steps for having £60,000 raised<pb n="137" /><anchor id="Pg137" />
by subscription and paid into the Chamber of London,
to be at the disposal of parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 167.</p></note> The money not
coming in so speedily as was desired, the Speaker
wrote a third time (19 Feb.) to the mayor, directing
him to summon a Common Hall and to lay before it
the extreme urgency of affairs.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 180.</p></note> The chief cause of the
delay in getting in the money was the dissatisfaction
felt in the city at Strafford's trial being put off so
long. The 17th February being at last fixed for his
trial, there was some hope that the money would
speedily now be forthcoming,<note place="foot"><p>"I think now we shall proceed clearly and speedily for moneys."
Uvedale to Bradley, 16 Feb., 1641.—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1640-1641),
p. 462.</p></note> and the same day the
Commons commissioned Sir William Uvedale to go to
the lord mayor and get an order for receiving the money
that had been collected up to £50,000.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 88.</p></note> Three days
later the Court of Aldermen made out the necessary
order for the Chamberlain to pay over the money.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 55, fo. 86.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Trial and Execution of Strafford." /><note place="margin"><p>Trial and execution of Strafford, March-May, 1641.</p></note>

<p>Again there was delay in bringing Strafford to
trial, and it was not until the 22nd March that he
was arraigned in Westminster Hall, where alone room
could be found for the crowds that were anxious to
witness the proceedings. The mayor took steps to
prevent a rush of people to Westminster and to
suppress any riot that might arise. From five o'clock
in the morning until nine at night a double watch was
kept at the city's gates and landing stages on the
river. The trained bands were held in readiness,
whilst servants and apprentices were ordered to keep
indoors.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 185b.</p></note> At the end of three weeks a Bill of Attainder<pb n="138" /><anchor id="Pg138" />
was brought in and read a first time (10 April), and
on the 21st April it was read a third time and passed.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 118, 125.</p></note>
The Lords would willingly have let matters rest here,
but the discovery of a design entertained by the
queen of bringing the defeated English army from the
north to Westminster to overawe the parliament, and
likewise of an attempt made by Charles to get
possession of the Tower that he might liberate
Strafford by force, hurried the unfortunate earl's end.
The citizens were determined not to rest until his
head was off his shoulders, and 20,000 Londoners
signed a petition addressed to both Houses (24 April)
demanding his execution on the ground that he had
advised the plundering of the city and putting it to
fine and ransom.<note place="foot"><p>Rushworth, iv, 233, 234.</p></note> The Peers deemed it advisable to
give way. They passed the Bill of Attainder and on
the 12th May Strafford was beheaded.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City stops the loan until justice is executed on Strafford, May, 1641.</p></note>

<p>The Lords had another pressing reason for giving
way, for until the citizens were assured that the full
penalty of the law would be executed on Strafford
they determined to stop payment of the loan. Writing
to Matthew Bradley on the 3rd May, the treasurer
of the army tells him "a strange story." "There is,"
he says, "money ready in the city, but none will be
delivered until justice be done upon my lord of
Strafford."<note place="foot"><p>Uvedale to Bradley, 3 May.—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1640-1641),
p. 569. The day after Strafford's execution the Court of Aldermen
intimated their readiness to pay over £80,000, part of £120,000 promised
by the City, to Sir William Uvedale and the Earl of Warwick.—Repertory
55, fo. 136.</p></note> On that very day, the letter continues,
there had been a crowd of 10,000 well-to-do persons
at Westminster—"citizens of very good account, some<pb n="139" /><anchor id="Pg139" />
worth £30,000, some £40,000" demanding justice
against Strafford and threatening to send their
servants the next day unless justice were speedily
executed. "Truly these unsettled times do much
trouble me."</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The &quot;Protestation&quot; accepted by the city." /><note place="margin"><p>The "Protestation" accepted by the City, May, 1641.</p></note>

<p>The discovery of the so-called "army plot" had
in the meanwhile led to a preamble being drawn
up to a document known as the "Protestation," or
declaration in favour of the reformed religion, in
which the danger from the army was for the first
time clearly mentioned. The Protestation passed
the Commons on the 3rd May,<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 132.</p></note> and on the following
day received the assent of the House of Lords.
On the 11th May a printed copy of this document
was introduced into the Court of Aldermen, when it
received the willing assent not only of the aldermen
present, but also of the Town Clerk and the City
Remembrancer.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 55, fo. 133.</p></note> On the 29th it was accepted by the

<p>Although the execution of Strafford somewhat
allayed the nation's fears of having "two armies

soon revived by a second army plot. The armies
thus became a constant source of danger as well as
expense, and it was determined to disband them.
Charles could not withhold his assent, and a poll

both armies without appealing to them for assistance,
parliament decided to adjourn from the 8th September
until the 20th October. The Commons were in need
of rest after the excitement of the session, and the
necessity for an adjournment was increased by another
visitation of the plague,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fos. 202, 229.</p></note> which had already driven
many members home without leave. The day preceding
the adjournment was appointed to be kept as
a day of thanksgiving for the peace; and, pursuant to
an order of both Houses, the mayor issued his precept
for shops to be closed and for the inhabitants of the<pb n="143" /><anchor id="Pg143" />
city to attend divine service, after which bells were to
be rung and bonfires lighted.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 221b; Journal House of Commons, ii, 276.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Reversal of judgment of forfeiture of Irish Estate." /><note place="margin"><p>Judgment of Star Chamber <emph>re</emph> the City's Irish estate reversed, 26 Aug., 1641.</p></note>

<p>Before the Commons separated they delivered
(26 Aug.) their judgment upon a petition<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fos. 164-166b.</p></note> which the
City had prepared for them in January touching its
estate in Londonderry, of which it had been deprived
in 1635 by sentence of the Court of Star Chamber.
That petition set forth the unwillingness of the City to
undertake the work of the Ulster plantation. It had
only been undertaken at the late king's earnest desire,
and subject to special articles, the City absolutely
refusing to be bound by the general articles drawn up
by his majesty for ordinary undertakers. The Irish
Society and the companies had expended more than
£130,000 (exclusive of money laid out by tenants) on
their estate "in hope to have in the future enjoyed
some benefitt of their great cost and charge." The
city of Londonderry and the town of Coleraine had
been rebuilt, and the castle of Culmore repaired and
entrenched. Fifteen churches had been either built or
repaired, besides a "very fair" church and free school
which had been erected in Derry at a cost of more
than £4,000. Roads had been made which had
converted one of the most barbarous places in the
kingdom into one of the most civilised. The society
and the companies, the petition went on to say, had
enjoyed this estate without interruption until Hilary
Term a° 6 Charles I (1631), when the Attorney-General,
Sir Robert Heath, exhibited an information
against the mayor, commonalty and citizens of London
and divers individuals, suggesting that they had<pb n="144" /><anchor id="Pg144" />
possessed themselves of the said lands and taken the
profits before any grant was made to them, and that
they had a greater quantity of lands than was intended
to be passed by the grant, and had by indirect means
procured divers privileges to be inserted in the grant
for which the Attorney General who passed the grant
had no warrant. Evidence of witnesses had been
taken on the matter, but before the cause came to a
hearing this information was dropt and another
exhibited in Hilary Term a° 8 Charles I (1633) against
the petitioners and the Irish Society, in which new
charges touching infringement of conditions of Letters
Patent were inserted, and upon these pretences the
Irish Society was adjudged by sentence of the Court
of Star Chamber in Hilary Term a° 10 Charles I
(1635) to pay a fine of £70,000 and to lose their
estate on the ground that the said Letters Patent
had been "unduly and surreptitiously obteyned to
the prejudice and deceipt of his majestie." The companies
refused to surrender their estates, and divers
lands belonging to the City and to the Bridgehouse
were seized to satisfy the fine, to the great prejudice
of the City. Being otherwise unable to redeem themselves
from the penalty of the Star Chamber sentence,
the companies were forced to consent to relinquish
their Irish estate and all arrears of rent, amounting to
£20,000. A <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">scire facias</foreign> was brought in and judgment
allowed by default, whereupon the companies lost
their estates, whilst the mayor and commonalty and
citizens of London, although not parties to any patent
or plantation—having done no more than lend their
name for the better transaction of the business and
for the purpose of raising money for the plantation,<pb n="145" /><anchor id="Pg145" />
which otherwise could never have been effected—were
fined £70,000. Seeing that the matter reflected so
badly upon the justice of the late as well as the
present king, the petitioners humbly prayed that a full
investigation of the whole proceedings might be made
and justice done.</p>

<p>Such was the nature of the petition which the
Common Council ordered in January (1641) to be
submitted to parliament. The House had its hands
too full to pay much attention to the City's grievance
until recently; but now, within a fortnight of their
adjournment for a well-earned rest, the Commons
declared<note place="foot"><p>26 Aug.—Journal 40, fo. 6b; Journal House of Commons, ii, 272.</p></note> the sentence in the Star Chamber to have
been unlawful and unjust. They declared that, in the
opinion of the House, the citizens of London had been
solicited and pressed to undertake the plantation of
Londonderry, that the king had not been deceived in
the grant to the new corporation of the Irish Society,
that no breach of covenant (if any there were) had
been committed sufficient to cause a forfeiture of the
lands, that the Star Chamber proceedings were <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">ultra
vires</foreign>, and that the citizens of London and all those
against whom judgment had been given in the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">scire

reinstated as they were before the sentence in the
Star Chamber.</p>

<p>Before the Houses again met, Richard Gurney, a
man of the same royalist proclivity as Garway, and
on that account, perhaps, described by Clarendon as
"a man of wisdom and courage," had been elected
mayor in succession to Edmund Wright.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 236.</p></note> The last<pb n="146" /><anchor id="Pg146" />
days of Wright's mayoralty were days of sickness and

from the north had made their way to London, where
they carried on a system of rapine and outrage. The
mayor issued precepts for search to be made in every
ward for suspected persons and disbanded soldiers,
as well as for keeping the streets well lighted at
night by candle and lanthorn, whilst public proclamation
was made by the king for soldiers to repair to
their own homes.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fos. 237b, 238. Return of the mayor to the council

<note place="margin"><p>The Irish rebellion of 1641.</p></note>

<p>Shortly after the House of Commons had resumed
its session attention was again drawn towards Ireland,
where a rebellion had broken out. Seeing how successful
Scotland had been in its resistance to England, the
Irish had determined to strike a blow for the recovery
of lands handed over to Protestant colonists, as well
as for religious liberty. Charles himself had held out
hopes of greater freedom to the Irish Catholics, who
saw no reason why they should be worse treated than
the rebellious Puritans of Scotland. The scene of
massacre and cruelty which followed has been described
by others, and remains to this day (in the words
of Carlyle) "a huge blot, an indiscriminate blackness,
one which the human memory cannot willingly
charge itself with."</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City asked for a loan of £50,000, 2 Nov., 1641.</p></note>

<p>As soon as news of the outbreak reached parliament,
application was forthwith made to the City

Gurney issued his precept<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, 240.</p></note> to the aldermen informing<pb n="147" /><anchor id="Pg147" />
them that on the previous day divers lords and others
of both Houses of Parliament had come to the
Common Council and asked for a loan of £50,000
at eight per cent. Seeing that the matter was of
so great importance, each alderman was desired to
take steps in conjunction with his deputy and common
councilmen of his ward to get liberal contributions
made towards the loan.<note place="foot"><p>Before the end of December nearly the whole amount had been
paid to the order of the Commons.—Journal 39, fo. 262; Repertory

<p>The attitude of the City now became more
marked. Whilst consenting to find the money
required, it asked parliament that the persons of the
Catholic lords might be secured, and that the bishops,
who were the cause of every good measure being
defeated in the Upper House, might be deprived of
their votes. It had a minor grievance in the custom
that had arisen of members of both Houses granting
their servants "protections" against creditors, a procedure
extremely prejudicial to the city merchant and
tradesman, and one which they would willingly see
remedied.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 314. As regards protections,

Dr. Gardiner<note place="foot"><p>"Hist. of England (1637-1649)," ii, 316.</p></note> characterises as being "the turning
point in the struggle," augured badly for Charles.
Nevertheless, he had friends in the city. The new
mayor was a strong royalist, as also were the
majority of the aldermen, and they took the
opportunity of Charles paying his first visit to the city<pb n="148" /><anchor id="Pg148" />
(25 Nov.) since he ascended the throne to demonstrate
their loyalty. On the 17th the Court of Aldermen
appointed a committee to make the necessary
arrangements,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 55, fo. 227.</p></note> whilst the mayor issued his precept
the same day to the civic companies to prepare a
certain number of their livery, well horsed and
apparelled, to assist him in escorting the king and
queen from the church of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, to
the Guildhall on the morning of the eventful day, and

his gratification at finding that the better class of
citizens were still loyal. "I see," said he, "that all
those former tumults and disorders have only risen
from the meaner sort of people, and that the
affections of the better and main part of the city
have ever been loyal and affectionate to my person
and government." He proceeded to assure his
hearers of his determination to maintain the true
Protestant religion as established by Elizabeth and
James, and he hoped with the assistance of parliament
to re-establish the trade of the country. But what
pleased the citizens perhaps more than anything was
a promise he made to restore to them their Londonderry
estate—at that moment in the hands of the
rebels, but soon, he hoped, to be recovered. The
Recorder was expressly commanded to wait upon his
majesty and see that this promise was punctually performed.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 9, 9b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Measures prepared for restoration of Irish estate, 30 Nov., 1641.</p></note>

<p>The Common Council took Charles at his word
and lost no time in appointing a committee for the
purpose of introducing a Bill in parliament for the
recovery of the city's Irish estate. The Recorder had
pointed out (20 Nov.) to the court that the "corporation"
(<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">i.e.</foreign> the Irish society) had been dissolved, and
it behoved them to consider in whose names the Irish
estate should be vested, whether in the name of the
mayor and commonalty of London or a "select company."</p>

<note place="margin"><p>A London mob at Westminster, Nov., 1641.</p></note>

<p>The disaffected element in the city, which had
voluntarily kept itself in the background, or had been
suppressed by force on the day of the king's visit,
again came to the surface as soon as the duties of
hospitality had been executed. Once more a crowd
gathered (29 Nov.) at Westminster, shouting "No
bishops!" encouraged (it was said) by John Venn, a
merchant taylor, who had succeeded Cradock, on the
latter's decease, as one of the city's representatives in
parliament. On the 10th December the mayor, acting
under orders from the king, issued his precept to the
aldermen to see that apprentices and servants were
kept within doors and not allowed to go abroad to
make tumult and hold unlawful meetings.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 253b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The character of the mob.</p></note>

<p>A difference of opinion existed as to the representative
character of those who had thus threatened
parliament. "You much mistake," wrote Thomas
Wiseman to Sir John Pennington ten days after the
riot had taken place, "if you think those seditious
meetings of sectaries and others ill affected, who
have lately been at the parliament-house to cry for
justice against the delinquent bishops, are the representative
body of the city—they are not, but the
representative body is the lord mayor, aldermen and
Common Council, who gave the entertainment to
the king and will stick to him and live and die in
his service."<note place="foot"><p>Wiseman to Pennington, 9 Dec.—Cal. State Papers Dom.
(1641-1643), p. 192.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Petition to the House, 11 Dec., 1641.</p></note>

<p>In order to dispel all doubts as to the respectability
of the agitators they determined to present a formal
petition to parliament for the removal of the bishops,
and to do the thing in style. "Accoutred in the best
manner they could," they rode to Westminster in
coaches, "to prevent the aspersion that they were of
the basest sort of people only which were that way
affected."<note place="foot"><p>Slingsby to Pennington, 16 Dec., 1641.—Cal. State Papers Dom.
(1641-1643), p. 202.</p></note> They declared that the petition was
signed by over 20,000 well-to-do citizens, including
aldermen and members of the Common Council, and
that many more signatures might have been obtained
but for the obstruction of divers "ill-affected persons."<note place="foot"><p>Maitland, i, 349-350.</p></note>
When the Commons came to inquire (20 Dec.) who
these ill-affected persons were, it was found that the
Mayor and the Recorder were the chief. The former
was declared to have said that the petition had found<pb n="152" /><anchor id="Pg152" />
favour only with ignorant or idle people, who did not
realise the danger they were in, and that the petition
"tended to mutiny." On hearing that part of the
petition which stated that it was the wish of the
"representative body" of the city to have the bishops
removed, the Recorder lost all control over himself,
and swore it was a lie. The petition, he said, tended
to sedition, and to set men together by the ears. So
far from tending to peace it was, he declared, "for
blood and cutting of throats; and if it came to
cutting of throats, thank yourselves; and your
blood be upon your own heads."<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 350.</p></note></p>

his appointment of Colonel Lunsford, a
debauched ruffian, as lieutenant of the Tower, in
place of Balfour, who was a favourite with the
city, increased the exasperation against him, and
the mayor was obliged to inform him (26 Dec.) that
unless Lunsford was removed he could not answer

Gurney had the desired effect, and Lunsford was

Lunsford himself. The officers drew their swords and
drove the close-cropt apprentices, or "roundheads"
as they were jeeringly called, out of Westminster,
chasing them up King Street as far as Whitehall.
Several of the rioters were hurt, but none killed. For
some days the excitement was so great that everyone
attending the court at Whitehall wore a sword;
and 500 gentlemen of the Inns of Court offered their
services to the king.<note place="foot"><p>Slingsby to Pennington, 30 Dec.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Ibid.</foreign>, p. 217.</p></note> On the 28th December Charles

and sent a letter to the City by the hand of Lord
Newburgh, in which he expressed his continued
confidence in the loyalty of the city, and ascribed the
recent tumults and distempers to "the meane and
unruly people of the suburbs." The Common

sorrow for the necessity that had brought him

treason. He had expected obedience and not an
answer. Careful as he was and always would be of the
privileges of the Commons, they were to know that
there was no privilege in matters of treason. Failing
himself to discover those whom he sought, he turned
to Lenthall and asked him if they were in the House.
"Do you see any of them?" The Speaker's reply
was singularly apt. "May it please your majesty,"
said he, falling on his knee before Charles, "I have
neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this
place but as this House is pleased to direct me,
whose servant I am here." Casting one more
glance round the House, and finding that the "birds had
flown," the king withdrew amid cries of "Privilege!
Privilege!" and the House immediately adjourned.</p>

<p>The king could not allow matters to rest here.
The next morning, being Wednesday, the 5th January,
he set out for the city with a small retinue, and<pb n="157" /><anchor id="Pg157" />
presented himself at the Guildhall when a Court of
Common Council was sitting. The city's archives are
searched in vain for any record of what took place
on that memorable occasion, but we have a vivid
account of the scene handed down to us by an eye-witness,
Captain Slingsby, who, happening to meet
the royal party on its way to the city, turned back
and followed it into the precincts of the Council
Chamber.<note place="foot"><p>Slingsby to Pennington, 6 Jan.—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1641-1643),
pp. 242-243; <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Cf.</foreign> "The arrest of the five members," by John
Foster, pp. 258-263.</p></note> Charles lost no time in coming to the point.
He had come, he said, to demand those persons
who had been already accused of high treason, and who
were believed at that moment to be lurking within
the city. He desired to bring them to a trial at law,
and depended upon those present for their assistance.
He was resolved to redress grievances and to preserve
the privileges of parliament, but he must "question
these traitors." After justifying the existence of a
guard at Whitehall and saying a few friendly words
to the aldermen, he invited himself to dinner with
one of the sheriffs, choosing the sheriff who was less
favourably disposed towards him, viz., sheriff Garrett.
The king's speech was followed by an ominous
pause. Then a cry, writes Slingsby, was raised in the
council, "Parliament! Privileges of parliament!" and
presently another, "God bless the king!" These
continued for some time, but he professes to be unable
to say which of the two was loudest. When silence
was restored the king asked that a spokesman should
make known to him their wishes. Thereupon a
member of the council arose and said, "It is the vote<pb n="158" /><anchor id="Pg158" />
of this court that your majesty hear the advice of
your parliament." This statement was at once
challenged by another, who cried out, "It is not the
vote of this court: it is your own vote." The king
replied by asking who it was that charged him with
not taking the advice of his parliament, adding that
he did take its advice and would continue to do so,
but, said he, "I must distinguish between the parliament
and some traitors in it," and these, he repeated,
"he would bring to trial—to trial." "No privileges
could protect a traitor from a trial." With this he
turned to leave the Council Chamber. On reaching
the outer hall he was again assailed with the cry
that had been made to ring in his ears all the way
from Whitehall to the city, "The privileges of parliament!"
Undaunted he made his way through the
mob to dine at Garrett's house, and later in the day,
amid the same cries, he returned to Whitehall.</p>

great increase of the fears of the citizens owing to
his attempt to seize the five members, the effect of
which was to prejudice the whole trade of the city

him to take steps for the speedy relief of the<pb n="159" /><anchor id="Pg159" />

for so doing was a public enemy. More than this,
the Committee declared that at a time when the king,
kingdom and parliament were "in very eminent and

of them, to make use of the trained bands or any

The appearance of the five members as they made
their way by water from the city to Westminster was<pb n="162" /><anchor id="Pg162" />
greeted with shouts of joy and firing of volleys. On
entering the House they publicly acknowledged the

Commons, and a promise of indemnity for their action
throughout the recent crisis.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ii, 370. Bere to Pennington, 13th

<note place="margin"><p>The Tower held for the king.</p></note>

<p>Everything now promised well for parliament
except the refusal of Sir John Byron, lieutenant of the
Tower, to submit to its orders. Once more the
seamen or mariners of London, who play no unimportant
part in the history of the city at political
crises, came forward. They offered to take the Tower
by assault. There was some talk of reducing the
fortress by starvation, and Byron confessed to secretary
Nicholas (22 Jan.)<note place="foot"><p>Byron to Nicholas, 22-28 Jan.—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1641-1643),

been carried out he could not long have held the
place, determined as he was to sell both the Tower and
his life at as dear a rate as he could. No such strict
investment, however, took place. Skippon attempted
to win over a portion of the garrison in the absence of
the lieutenant, but failed. The Tower, however,
became less an object of fear to the citizens as its
stock of munition of war became less every day by
reason of shipments to Ireland.</p>

<p>It was to Ireland that Charles looked for assistance
in his struggle with parliament. It behoved the latter,
therefore, to use its utmost endeavours to reduce that
country to subjection. A deputation from the House
waited on the Common Council (22 Jan.) with a request<pb n="163" /><anchor id="Pg163" />
for a loan of £100,000. Whilst this request was
under consideration the mayor was directed by the
council to write to all the livery companies interested
in the Londonderry estate, and exhort them to
contribute bread and corn for the relief of the
plantation.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 17, 17b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's reply, 24 Jan., 1642.</p></note>

<p>Two days later (24 Jan.) the City resolved not
to accede to the request. Answer was sent that
they were unable to raise money for a foreign war
by way of a tax, and it was hopeless to raise the
money by voluntary contributions. The House was
reminded that the City had already advanced a sum
of £50,000 on the express understanding that troops
should forthwith be despatched to Ireland, but none
had gone. The citizens would refuse to lend more
until assured that relief had been actually sent to
Londonderry. The House was further reminded that
the City was dissatisfied with the remissness shown
in disarming Papists and pressing of soldiers, as well
as in displacing the lieutenant of the Tower, and
appointing one well approved by parliament. A similar
representation was made to the House of Lords.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 18-19b.</p></note></p>

that there were 10,000,000 acres in Ireland liable to confiscation, and
that there would be no difficulty in raising £1,000,000 if a quarter of
these lands, or 2,500,000 acres, were assigned to subscribers.</p></note> The suggestion was<pb n="164" /><anchor id="Pg164" />

made to the city for more pecuniary assistance. The

widening. Charles was known to be collecting forces
around him in spite of a formal prohibition by the
Commons, who now more distinctly asserted their
claim to sovereignty. On Thursday, the 2nd June, a
deputation of Lords and Commons presented themselves
before the livery of the several companies
assembled in Common Hall, and desired a loan of
£100,000 towards "the relief and preservation of the
kingdom of Ireland" and "speedy supply of the great
and urgent necessities of this kingdom." The money
was voted "most freely and with great alacrity," and
was to be raised by the companies according to their
corn assessment, as on previous occasions. On
the 4th June the Commons passed an ordinance

<p>It was the general opinion of both parties that

much adverse comment by royalists, and led to two

it. Secondly, there had been recently a riot at St.
Paul's, and the rioters had been committed to prison,
and he desired to know what proceedings should be
taken against them. Lastly, he had to complain of
the seditious character of the sermons preached at St.
Paul's, the preacher being appointed by the Bishop
of London. Indeed, they had been so bad that he
and his brother aldermen had ceased to attend. He
asked that the appointment of preachers might be
vested in the lord mayor, according to a former order
of their lordships. On the first two questions an
immediate answer was given. As to the proclamation
for the adjournment of the term, it had received the
sanction of the Lords, and therefore the mayor was at
liberty to publish it. Touching the rioters at St. Paul's,
they might be proceeded with according to law. The
question as to the appointment of preachers at St.

<p>The first serious conflict between the forces of
king and parliament took place at Edge-hill (23 Oct.),
when both parties claimed the victory. With Charles,
however, rested the more immediate fruits of success,
for he had overcome the first obstacle that stood
in his way to London. That Charles did not
enter London as a conqueror was owing to the<pb n="175" /><anchor id="Pg175" />
determined front shown to his forces by the trained
bands of the City, and the energy displayed by
the inhabitants at large. If anything were needed
to stimulate exertion on the part of the Londoners,
they found it in the reports which daily arrived
of country houses being despoiled by the royalist
soldiery. Few doubted that if allowed to enter
the city the wealth of London would be at their
mercy. "You see what is threatened you," said the
Earl of Holland to the citizens at the Guildhall, soon
after the battle, "you must know what to expect and
what to trust to; they intend you no lesse (and that
is to be believed) than the destroying of the city,

resolved to change it for the more effective system of
raising money by taxation. The rest of the kingdom
would thus bear its share of the burden, which until
now had been chiefly borne by the city of London.
Inhabitants of the city who had never before contributed
to so-called voluntary loans would now be
compelled to pay their quota. Those who had not
already contributed to the support of the army were
now compelled to do so, in money, plate, horse,
horsemen or arms. Every man was to be assessed<pb n="177" /><anchor id="Pg177" />

were of frequent occurrence. To many the state of
affairs had become little less than disastrous, owing to
the shutting up of shops and the stoppage of trade.
The new parliamentary taxation increased the general
dissatisfaction and made the citizens sigh for peace.
On the 12th December two petitions were laid before
the Common Council. Both petitions advocated
peace. One of them was objected to by the court
as too dictatorial in tone and as casting an aspersion
on parliament. They nevertheless ordered it to be
entered on record, "to the end their dislike might the
better appear."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 43.</p></note> Whilst these petitions were under<pb n="178" /><anchor id="Pg178" />
consideration in the Council Chamber, which stood
almost on the same spot as that on which the present

proceeding from an angry crowd in the adjacent hall.
On all sides there arose a clamour for peace. The
lives of the lord mayor and the unpopular aldermen
were even threatened. The few soldiers who happened
to be present received some rough handling, and were
told to go and spend the money they had received
from the State at the tavern, for they should have no
more. At last a body of the city trained bands
arrived and order was restored. The Common Council
continuing its deliberations set aside both petitions, but
appointed a committee to draw up on its behalf two
other petitions advocating a cessation of hostilities, one
to be presented to the king and the other to parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 43b, 44.</p></note></p>

<p>Having obtained the sanction of parliament to

"Mr. Secretary Falkland to learn his majesties
pleasure whether certeine citizens might with safety

and in the meanwhile nominated the members of

satisfactory.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 45b.</p></note> The reply was favourable, and the
deputation set out for Oxford, where Charles had

of the House of Lords, v, 548, 549.</p></note>
They arrived in Oxford, said they, between one and
two o'clock on the afternoon of Monday, the 2nd
January (1643), and an hour later waited upon Lord
Falkland at his lodgings in New College. At five
o'clock the same evening they were admitted into
the king's presence and the City's petition was then
publicly read. The king professed satisfaction at
seeing them, for he could now be sure that certain
printed declarations of his would reach those for
whom they were intended. He questioned very much
the ability of the City to protect his person, seeing
that it was unable to preserve peace among themselves.
On Wednesday (4 Jan.) the deputation was dismissed
with a promise that Charles would send an answer
by Mr. Herne (or Heron), one of his own servants,
who would accompany them on their return. He
asked which was the larger assembly, the Common
Council or the Common Hall. On being told that
the latter were more numerous he directed that his<pb n="180" /><anchor id="Pg180" />
answer should be read there, as he wished as many
as possible to be disabused and to know the truth.
Just when the deputation was about to set out from
Oxford on its return a printed paper purporting to be
the king's answer was handed to Sir George Garrett
and Sir George Clark as they sat in their coach.
The Common Council having heard the whole story
of the mission to Oxford deemed it expedient to inform
the House of Commons of the result, and to lay the
printed paper in their hands.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 46b.</p></note> This was accordingly
done on the 11th January, with the result that the

When the Common Hall met at the appointed

throw off their yoke, and to begin by arresting the
lord mayor and certain leading citizens who had been
guilty of treason. When this had been done, and not
before, he would be prepared to return to London
without the protection of his army, or, to use the
expression of the petitioners themselves, with his

Castle Street is said to commemorate a rampart at Southampton House,
in Holborn, whilst Mount Street is believed to take its name from a
large earthwork known as "Oliver's Mount."—Loftie, "Hist. of

The City had a hard task to get subscriptions
in from the outlying districts, and was consequently
obliged to advance out of its own Chamber no less
than six sums of £2,000 each between the months of
March and July lest the work of erecting the necessary
fortifications should be brought to a standstill.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 56, 59, 59b, 61, 65, 66b.</p></note></p>

<p>In the face of this extraordinary expenditure the

reduced. On the 1st March Colonel Venn, one
of the city's members, informed the Common Council
that the application to have the assessment reduced

the City an additional monthly sum of £3,000 in aid

<note place="margin"><p>News of Prince Rupert threatening Bristol, 10 March.</p></note>

<p>On the 10th March a deputation from both
Houses, including Pym, informed the Common Council
of a message that had recently arrived from the Earl
of Essex to the effect that Prince "Robert" (Rupert)<pb n="185"/><anchor id="Pg185" />
had arrived with a large force within four miles of
Bristol, and the earl intended forthwith to make an
advance. His army, however, was sadly in arrears of
payment; he wanted both men and money, and this
fact he had desired to be represented to the citizens
of London. Pym, therefore, in the name of both
Houses desired the Common Council to hasten as far
as possible the payment of the residue of the £60,000
already promised, and to furnish such forces as the
city could spare.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's answer to a request for men and money.</p></note>

<p>As far as the first part of the request went the
council promised its ready assistance.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 54b.</p></note> It frankly
acknowledged that little more than one-third of the
whole amount promised had come in, but there were
difficulties in the way of getting it in. A large sum
of money—as much as £30,000—which ought to
have been repaid to the lenders out of the estates of
malignants was still owing, and lenders were thereby
discouraged. Men of ability refused to lend, and
there were no means of forcing them; whilst divers
rich men had left the city, carrying with them what
property they could, and leaving their houses empty.
Nevertheless, the council assured the deputation that it
was well affected to parliament, all but a very few of
its members having already contributed, and it would
forthwith take steps to get the money in. Touching
the furnishing of soldiers, the council remarked that
there were but three regiments in the city besides
the trained bands, two of which were on active service
and the one remaining was on outpost duty.<note place="foot"><p>Pym's report to the Commons, 11 March.—Journal House of

<p>Soon after the outbreak of the war it was seen
that the weak point of the parliamentary army lay in
its cavalry. Already something had been done towards
remedying this defect. Volunteers had offered themselves
for the formation of a troop of horse at their
own expense, and a "seminary" for cavalry had been
established.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 56, fo. 72b-73</p></note> The news about Rupert urged the
citizens to a greater effort. On the 15th March an
offer was made to the Common Council to raise no less
than ten volunteer regiments, three of which were to
consist of cavalry. The men were to receive no pay
except when engaged on active service, and only a
small sum was asked for, in order to provide colours,
drums and other necessaries. The offer was gladly
accepted.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 55b.</p></note></p>

<p>The East India Company was at the same time

ordnance and provisions were to be seized, on the
understanding that the City would restore them in as

Irritated at the king's obstinacy, the Puritan party
vented its spleen by ordering the wholesale destruction

by asking parliament to sanction the removal of
Cheapside cross, "in regard of the idolatrous and

<p>Now that all hopes of a peaceful settlement had
gone, Charles took measures to gain over as many
Londoners as he could to his side. He had previously
(16 March) caused a commission of array to be drawn,<pb n="188" /><anchor id="Pg188" />
addressed to Gardiner, who was still Recorder, and
others, authorising them to raise a force on his behalf
in the city.<note place="foot"><p>Howell's State Trials, iv, 628-630.</p></note> This commission he had retained at
Oxford until he could find an opportunity for conveying
it safely to London. It was now entrusted to Lady
Daubeny to carry to London. She succeeded in her
mission and handed the document over to a city
linendraper named Chaloner, who, in his turn,
transferred it to Tompkins, a brother-in-law of Waller
the poet, who was also implicated in the design which
on that account came to be known as "Waller's Plot."
Tompkins endeavoured to conceal it in a cellar, but it
did not escape the prying eyes of parliamentary
searchers. Early in the morning of the 31st May
Tompkins was arrested, and in the course of time both
he and Chaloner paid the penalty of their rashness by
being hanged in front of their own houses, the one
in Cornhill and the other in Holborn. Waller was
also taken and flung into prison.<note place="foot"><p>Clarendon (ed. 1839), 415-419; Rushworth, v, 325, 326, 330.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Royalist successes, June-July, 1643.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime Essex had besieged and taken
Reading (26 April), but his troops became affected
with disease, and he made no attempt to advance on
Oxford until June.  Before his arrival Hampden had<pb n="189" /><anchor id="Pg189" />
received a mortal wound at Chalgrove Field (18 June).
On the 5th July the royalist forces under Hopton
worsted the parliamentary army under Waller in the
west, whilst a similar success was achieved against
Fairfax in the north (30 June). The king had reason
to be elated as he rode into Oxford (14 July)
accompanied by the queen, from whom he had been
separated for fifteen months, amid the shouts of men
and the ringing of bells.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Newcastle to be reduced if possible, May, 1643.</p></note>

<p>Parliament and the City, on the other hand,
had reason to be dejected. On the 17th July Charles
issued a proclamation for seizing all merchandise on
its way to London. The trade of the city became
paralysed.<note place="foot"><p>Maitland, i, 362, 371.</p></note> Nor was this all. For some months
past the citizens had been suffering from a scarcity of
coal. Ever since the appointment of the Earl of Newcastle
as governor of the town of Newcastle in June,
1642,<note place="foot"><p>News letter from York, 17 June, 1642.—Cal. State Papers Dom.
(1641-1643), p. 342.</p></note> that town had been held for Charles, and a
refusal to allow its coal to be supplied to the
supporters of parliament had brought the city of
London and the eastern counties into great straits.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 60.</p></note>
It thus became a matter of prime importance that
Newcastle should be captured. How this was to be
accomplished was set out in a series of propositions
drawn up (25 May, 1643) by the Common Council of
the city to be laid before parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 61.</p></note> A monopoly
of the trade in coal, salt and glass with the north of
England was to be held out as an incentive for
persons to adventure their money in the reduction<pb n="190" /><anchor id="Pg190" />
of the town. A committee, of which one-half of its
members was to be nominated by the Commons and
the rest by the City, was to have charge of all the
money subscribed and to direct the undertaking. The
propositions were well received (26 May),<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iii, 104, 105.</p></note> and on
the 10th June the Common Council nominated three
aldermen and seven common councilmen to join with

<p>To make matters worse news arrived on the
18th July that royalist cavalry were in the vicinity
of London, and that great disaffection to the cause of
parliament had manifested itself in the neighbouring
counties of Kent and Surrey. The Common Council,
recognising the danger, forthwith resolved to raise
what money it could at the rate of eight per cent.,
and to place it at the disposal of the Committee of
the Militia of the city.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 68.</p></note></p>

<p>The danger which threatened London was
increased the more by reason of dissensions which

usually met at Salters' Hall fell out with the Committee

direction of both Houses of Parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 67b.</p></note> On the

laid before the Commons by a deputation of aldermen
and common councilmen, and received the approval
of the House. The outcome of all this was that the
House eventually passed a resolution (29 July) that
"Sir William Waller do command in chief all the
forces raised within the city of London, and all
other forces that are or shall be under the command
of the militia of London, subordinate to the lord

<p>Waller's appointment was a distinct slur upon

order to prejudice him in the eyes of the City. The
Common Council took an early opportunity of deprecating
strongly these false rumours, and appointed
(1 Aug.) a deputation to wait upon "his excellency"

the representative body of the city—had of his

As soon as the City became aware of this there was

<p>If the Londoners fairly claimed some credit for
the part they had taken towards the relief of

bold stand they made a fortnight later (20 Sept.), at
Newbury, against repeated charges of Rupert's far-famed
cavalry. Again and again did Rupert's horse
dash down upon the serried pikes of the London
trained bands, but never once did it succeed in breaking
their ranks, whilst many a royalist saddle was emptied
by the city's musketeers, whose training in the Artillery
Garden and Finsbury Fields now served them in good
stead. Whilst the enemy's cannon was committing<pb n="196" /><anchor id="Pg196" />
fearful havoc in the ranks of the Londoners they still
stood their ground "like so many stakes," and drew
admiration even from their enemies for their display

"were, in truth, the preservation of that army that

On the 28th November the sheriffs of London, accompanied

Fowke or Foulke, a leading spirit in the city and
staunch parliamentarian, was one of the sheriffs at
the time, and acted as spokesman. He laid before the
House a plain statement as to how matters stood.
The fact was that the troops were unpaid, and that no
money was forthcoming. If money was found for the
trained bands the civic authorities, in consideration of
the critical times, promised to do their best to persuade
them to remain longer in the field. The House resolved
to raise £5,000 for the city's forces on this understanding.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iii, 323.</p></note>

Whilst accepting the services of one who was a warm
Catholic, Charles addressed a letter to the mayor and
aldermen, in which he assured them of his "constancy
in religion." He foolishly imagined that such an
assurance would induce the City to break at once with
parliament and declare for peace. The letter, as luck
would have it, fell into the hands of the Committee
of Safety. The plot was discovered, and full particulars
of it laid before the Commons (6 Jan., 1644).<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iii, 358.</p></note></p>

<p>The discovery led to stricter precautions being
taken to prevent inhabitants of the city leaving the
city to join the king at Oxford, as many ill-affected
persons had already done. The number of passes
was reduced, and the keys of the portcullises of the
city's gates were ordered for the future to remain in

the Lords and Commons passed through Cheapside,

authority at Westminster which should control both
armies in common. Hence it was that on the 16th<pb n="199" /><anchor id="Pg199" />
February a Committee of Both Kingdoms, composed

Cheriton (29 March) reached London it was received<pb n="200" /><anchor id="Pg200" />
with enthusiastic joy, and, for a time at least, all
thoughts of peace were set aside. The City assisted
parliament to raise a sum of £20,000 (3 April) and
authorised the purchase of 3,000 muskets and 1,000
pikes on the credit of the weekly meal money
(3 April).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 91b, 92.</p></note> The Commons ordered a public thanksgiving

putting an end to the existing distractions. It was
purposed to draw all available forces together to
a general rendezvous at Aylesbury by the 19th of the

"as one man," for it was to no purpose "to go

<p>Three days later (12 April) the Committee of

<p>Great delay took place in getting the parliamentary
forces into the field. The 19th April, the
day appointed for the rendezvous at Aylesbury,
arrived and found Essex still unprepared. It was not
until the 2nd May that the Committee of the Militia
of the city informed the Common Council that three
regiments out of the six to be called out were then in
readiness to march. The committee asked the sanction
of the council before giving orders for the regiments
to start because, they said, their powers had
been much limited by their last commission (8 April).
The council was in favour of the regiments setting
out at once towards Uxbridge, according to instructions
left behind by Essex, and the committee was
directed to draft an ordinance for parliament to the
effect that none of the forces might be kept longer
abroad or sent further from London than the committee
should from time to time think fit, and that
the forces should be conducted and commanded by
such major-general and other officers of the brigade
as the committee should appoint.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 94b; Letter Book QQ, fo. 112b.</p></note> It was a repetition

<p>In the meantime the Committee of Both Kingdoms

would at once satisfy both Houses as well as be
acceptable to Charles. At length the proposals
were laid before the Commons and read the first
time (29 April). The second reading was appointed
for the 1st May. Before any further steps were
taken in the matter it was but right that the citizens
of London, without whose aid the issue of
the struggle between king and parliament might
have been very different to what it was, should be
consulted. A deputation was therefore appointed
(3 May) by the House to wait on the mayor,
aldermen and common council of the city and
to express to them the willingness of parliament to
consider any proposals that they might think fit to
make on behalf of the city, and to lay them before
the king.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iii, 472, 477.</p></note> The City thanked parliament and referred

<note place="margin"><p>Suspected persons from  Oxford to be expelled from the city, 15 May.</p></note>

<p>For some time past there had been a flow of

would return to their duty and take the covenant.<note place="foot"><p>Gardiner, i, 353.</p></note>
During 1643 the flow had been in the opposite direction.
It now became necessary to see that only
genuine converts found their way into the city, and to
this end parliament ordered (15 May) the mayor to
take steps for the expulsion from the city and lines of
communication of all suspicious persons such as had
lately come from Oxford, or any other of the king's
quarters, all recusants, the wives of recusants and the<pb n="203" /><anchor id="Pg203" />

<note place="margin"><p>The City's petition for re-appointment of the committee, 16 May, 1644.</p></note>

<p>Meanwhile the term of three months for which
the Committee of Both Kingdoms had been originally
appointed was fast drawing to a close, and considerable
difference of opinion had manifested itself
between the Lords and Commons as to its re-appointment.
The former were in favour of increasing the
numbers of the committee, with the view no doubt of
giving a larger representation to the peace party,
whilst the latter advocated a simple renewal of the
powers of the committee as it then stood. At this
juncture, when the country seemed likely to be left
without any central authority to direct the movements
of the parliamentary forces, the City presented
a petition (16 May) to the Commons<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 97b; Rushworth, v, 710.</p></note> setting forth
the danger that was likely to arise from the discontinuance
of the committee, and praying that it might
speedily be re-established as the present urgency of
affairs required. The citizens took the opportunity of
praying the Commons to see that the Tower of London,
Windsor Castle and Tilbury Fort remained in
good hands and were properly supplied with necessaries,
and further that none of the members of the
House who had returned from Oxford might be readmitted
to their seats until they had given satisfactory
pledges for their fidelity in the future. The
re-admission of these members had been a cause of a
long wrangle between the two Houses.</p>

<p>Two days later (18 May) a deputation from the

They gratefully acknowledged the assistance they had
received from the city, without which they would have
been unable to achieve what they had done. An
ordinance, they said, was being proceeded with for
the continuance of the Committee of Both Kingdoms;
measures would be taken respecting the Tower,
Windsor Castle and Tilbury Fort such as would be for
the security and satisfaction of the City; and the
House had already passed an ordinance touching the
re-admission of members which it would see carried
into execution. The answer concluded by again
acknowledging the obligation that parliament was
under to the City for spending its blood and treasure
for the public good, which the House would ever
have in remembrance and would endeavour to requite.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The old Committee of Both Kingdoms resume work, 24 May.</p></note>

<p>Just as matters were coming to a dead-lock the
crisis was averted by the happy thought of reviving
an old ordinance which had already received the
sanction of the Lords, but had hitherto been ignored
and laid aside by the Commons. This ordinance,
which proposed to confer unlimited powers on the
committee, was now taken up and passed by the
Commons, and thus the old committee was enabled
to meet on the 24th May and continue its work.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iii, 498, 500, 501, 503-505.</p></note></p>

<p>Parliament was still sadly in need of money, and
on the 27th May appointed a committee, of which the
Recorder and one or two of the city aldermen were
members, to consider how best to raise it, "either by<pb n="205" /><anchor id="Pg205" />

of Abingdon had recently been abandoned by the
royalists and occupied by Essex, whilst Waller was
advancing in the direction of Wantage, to gain, if
possible, a passage over the Thames above Oxford,
and thus cut off Charles from the west of England.
Both generals sent notice of their movements to
parliament, and on the 28th their letters (or an
abstract of them) were read before the Common
Council by a deputation of the recently appointed
committee, and a request was made that the City
would furnish the House with a sum of £200,000
or £300,000 upon the security of the estates of
delinquents. Notwithstanding the difficulty the City
was then experiencing in getting in the arrears of the
monthly assessment and the weekly meal account, it
at once took steps to carry out the wishes of
parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 99; Journal House of Commons, iii, 509;

Charles was at large, not only was the prospect of an
end of the war more than ever remote, but the safety

Essex and Waller to forget all past differences and to
strengthen each other in a joint attack upon the
royalist army wherever it may be found. Instead
of this the two generals went different ways; Essex
marched westward, leaving Waller to pursue Charles
as best he could. To make matters worse, disaffection

<p>That the city trained bands had done good service
in their day no one will deny, but the time was fast
approaching when it would be necessary to raise
an army of men willing to devote themselves to
the military life as a profession. For permanent
service in the field the London trained bands were not
to be relied on. "In these two days' march," wrote
Waller (2 July) to the Committee of Both Kingdoms,
"I was extremely plagued with the mutinies of the
City Brigade, who are grown to that height of
disorder that I have no hope to retain them, being<pb n="207" /><anchor id="Pg207" />
come to their old song of Home! Home!" There
was, he said, only one remedy for this, and that was
a standing army, however small;—"My lords, I
write these particulars to let you know that an army
compounded of these men will never go through
with your service, and till you have an army
merely your own, that you may command, it is in a
manner impossible to do anything of importance."<note place="foot"><p>Extract from Committee Letter Book, cited by Dr. Gardiner,
"Hist. Great Civil War," i, 453-454.</p></note>
The junction of his forces with those under Browne,
who had been despatched (23 June) to protect the
country between London and the royalist army, served
only to increase the general discontent. "My London
regiments," he wrote (8 July), "immediately looked
on his [<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">i.e.</foreign> Browne's] forces as sent to relieve them,
and without expectation of further orders, are most
of them gone away; yesterday no less than 400
out of one regiment quitted their colours. On the
other side, Major-General Browne's men, being
most of them trained band men of Essex and Hertfordshire,
are so mutinous and uncommandable that
there is no hope of their stay. They are likewise
upon their march home again. Yesterday they were
like to have killed their Major-General, and they have
hurt him in the face.... I am confident that
above 2,000 Londoners ran away from their colours."<note place="foot"><p>Extract from Committee Letter Book, cited by Dr. Gardiner,

The same spirit of insubordination manifested itself
again when Waller threw himself (20 July) into
Abingdon. Most of his troops were only too anxious
to leave him, whilst the Londoners especially refused
to stir "one foot further, except it be home."<note place="foot"><p>.<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id. ibid.</foreign>, i, 456.</p></note></p>

<p>All this was not unnatural if unpatriotic. The
absence of these men from their counters and shops
portended bankruptcy to many. Even those who
stayed at home found difficulty in carrying on their
commercial pursuits, owing to the war. Credit had
been given to persons who at the outbreak of the war
threw in their lot with the king. Their estates had
thereupon been sequestrated by parliament, and the
city merchant, tradesman or craftsman was left to
recover his debt as best he could. At length (2 Aug.,
1644) the Common Council took the matter up, and
agreed to petition parliament that delinquents might
be brought to judgment, and that in all cases of
sequestration provision might be made for payment
of all just debts out of delinquents' estates.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 103-103b.</p></note> Another

the City's right to the conservancy of the Thames, the

further urged to empower the Common Council to
correct, amend or repeal any by-law made or
procured by any company or mistery of London,
notwithstanding any statute or law to the contrary,
and generally to extend the powers of the City.
Lastly, it was proposed that, as the city had grown
very populous, the citizens should be allowed to
send two additional burgesses to parliament. The
consideration of these propositions by the Commons
was put off until October, when (25th) the House
resolved that the City should be desired to reduce the
number of propositions and to state specifically a few
of the most important and to bring forward the rest
in general terms, so that the propositions of the two

the safety and good government of the city, with the
approval of both Houses, might be confirmed by Act of
parliament. These six propositions were ordered to be
forthwith presented to parliament by the Recorder
and by alderman Pennington (as lieutenant of the

<p>In the meantime better news arrived from the

of the parliamentary soldiers as well as of the citizens
of London. The city might now look for a plentiful
supply of coal, a commodity which had become so
scarce that in July the civic authorities had received
permission from parliament to dig for turf and peat, by

<p>The close of the year (1644) found the trade

Commercial intercourse with the woollen and linen
manufacturers of the west of England had been
almost entirely cut off, whilst the blockade of the
east coast by the royalist navy deprived the city of a
great amount of corn, fish, butter, cheese and other
provisions. The citizens were greatly opposed to free

were in the hands of the royalists,<note place="foot"><p>See schedule of "Reasons against free trade to or from any ports

<p>Early in the following year (31 Jan., 1645) a
conference was opened at Uxbridge to discuss three
propositions for peace which parliament had offered
to Charles at Oxford in November last. These propositions
involved the abolition of Episcopacy, and the
placing the entire command of the army and navy, as
well as the future conduct of the war with Ireland, in
the hands of parliament. From the outset it appeared
very unlikely that Charles would bring himself to
accept the terms thus offered. After three weeks'
discussion negotiations were broken off and the
so-called "Treaty of Uxbridge" fell to the ground.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City advances £80,000, 4 March, 1645.</p></note>

<p>The failure of the negotiations at Uxbridge
hastened the passing of an ordinance for re-modelling
the army and placing it on such a footing that the
men should be in receipt of constant pay and the
officers selected for military efficiency alone. Ever
since November the "New Model" ordinance—as it
was called—had been under consideration. In January
it passed the Commons, but the Lords hesitated
until the difference of opinion that had manifested
itself at Uxbridge induced them to give their assent
(15 Feb.). On the 4th March a deputation from both
Houses came into the city and informed the Common
Council that, the Treaty of Uxbridge having fallen
through, the Houses had resolved "to put their forces
into the best posture they can for the vigorous
prosecution of the war, as the best means now left
(under God) for the obtaining of peace." Parliament
had passed an ordinance—they proceeded to say—for
raising £50,000 a month for nine months for
payment of an army under Sir Thomas Fairfax, and
they now asked the City to advance a sum of £80,000
on the security of the money so to be raised in the
last five months out of the nine. The matter was
referred to a committee to carry out.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 125.</p></note></p>

the original purport of which was to exclude all
members of either House from commands in the
army, but was afterwards so far modified as to
compel existing officers to resign their appointments,
leaving it to parliament to re-appoint them if it would.
Essex, Waller and Manchester resigned, but when
the time came for Cromwell, the prime mover in the
re-organisation of the army, to follow suit, he and two
or three others were re-appointed to commands in the
new army. The immediate effect of the passing of this
ordinance upon the city of London was that Pennington,
who had been appointed by parliament lieutenant
of the Tower, had to resign his post. The nomination
of his successor was, however, left with the Common
Council, who sent up the name of Colonel Francis
West for the approval of the Commons (24 April).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 126.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Military activity in the city, April, 1645.</p></note>

<p>Whilst the army was undergoing a process of
reformation outside London, considerable activity prevailed
within the city with the object of strengthening
its position. The Committee of Militia was instructed
to raise a sufficient number of men to guard the city
forts so that the trained bands might be free for more
active duties. Large sums of money were voted to
pay arrears due to gunners, "mattrosses" and workmen
who had been engaged in erecting the fortifications.
The sum of £500 was ordered to be laid out in the
purchase of gunpowder. The scout-master for the city
was encouraged in his duty of bringing information of
movements of the royalist army by the payment of
arrears due to him, and steps were taken to bring up
the regiments of the city auxiliaries to their full
complement by enlistments from the several wards.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 125b, 128.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The siege of Oxford, 22 May, 1645.</p></note>

<p>The first serious undertaking confided to Fairfax
and the New Model army was the siege of Oxford.
The utter uselessness of such an enterprise, whilst
Charles was free to roam the country and deal blows
wherever opportunity offered, failed to make itself
apparent to the Committee of Both Kingdoms, which
still governed the movements of the parliamentary
army. The siege being resolved upon, a deputation
from both Houses waited on the Common Council
(16 May) to ask for assistance in furnishing a force
to set out under Major-General Browne to join
Fairfax and Cromwell in the undertaking.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 128b.</p></note> Four days

<p>Whilst the main force of the parliamentary army
was wasting time in besieging Oxford, care was taken
to keep the country open round Taunton, recently set
free by a detachment sent by Fairfax. For this
purpose Massey, the governor of Gloucester, was
ordered to quit his post and march towards Bristol.<note place="foot"><p>The committee of both kingdoms to Massey, 24 May.—Cal. State

The prospect of losing their governor, who had
achieved so many military successes in the neighbourhood,
threw the inhabitants of Gloucester into terrible
consternation, and they went so far as to petition
parliament against his removal; but somehow or
other their petition failed to be read before the
Commons. In their distress they caused their mayor<pb n="217" /><anchor id="Pg217" />
to address a letter to the city of London (29 May)
stating the facts of the case, and praying that the
Londoners, who had already done so much to save
them from the hand of the enemy, would interpose with
the Commons on their behalf, so that Colonel Massey
might be allowed to remain. The civic authorities
agreed (7 June) to lay the matter before parliament;<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 132, 133.</p></note>
but in spite of all representations Massey had to go.
The Londoners themselves were asked (9 June) to
furnish 500 mounted musketeers for Massey's expedition,
and were encouraged to do so by "motives"
setting forth the gallant behaviour of the brigade in
and about Taunton, and the critical condition it was
in by being cut off from provisions. The Common
Council ordered the motives to be printed and circulated,
with the result that sufficient money was
raised to fit out 500 dragoons.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 132b, 133. The Committee of Both Kingdoms to

<p>In the meantime considerable dissatisfaction
manifested itself in the city at the state of affairs in
general, and more particularly with the manner in
which the movements of Fairfax and the New Model
army were hampered by orders from home. A
petition from divers inhabitants of the city with
certain suggestions was laid before the Common
Council for presentation to parliament. It was not
customary, however, for the Common Council to present
petitions to parliament unless drawn up by themselves,
but as the feelings of the court were in
sympathy with the petitioners it ordered two petitions
to be drawn up embracing the substance of the<pb n="218" /><anchor id="Pg218" />
original petition, and these were presented, one to
each of the Houses. After setting forth what they
esteemed to be the reasons for the ill success of the
parliamentary cause, the petitioners made known their
own wishes. In the first place, they desired that the
army of Fairfax should be recruited, and that the general
might be allowed greater freedom of action. Secondly,
that steps should be taken, before it was too late, to
recover Leicester, which had recently (31 May) fallen
into the king's hands. Thirdly, that the Scots should
be urged to march southward. Fourthly, that Cromwell
should be placed in command of the Eastern
Association. Fifthly, that adequate convoys should
be provided for merchants; and lastly, that parliament
should publish its own account of the recent
negotiations, as well as its resolutions against free
trade by sea to such ports as were in the king's
hands.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 131.</p></note> The petition, which was presented by Alderman

<p>One of the wishes expressed in the City's petition
was soon realised, for within a week Cromwell was
appointed, not to the command of the Eastern
Association as suggested, but to a still greater command,
viz., the lieutenant-generalship of the army, an
office which, by long prescription, carried also the
command of the cavalry, an arm of the service in<pb n="219" /><anchor id="Pg219" />

<p>Fairfax, being now allowed a free hand, abandoned
the siege of Oxford and set off in pursuit of the royal
army. He came up with them at Naseby, where on
the 14th June he succeeded, with the help of Cromwell
and his cavalry, in obtaining a signal victory and
utterly crushing the power of Charles in the field.
Among the wounded on the parliamentary side was
the City's old friend Skippon, "shot under the arme
six inches into his flesh." The pain of having his
wound dressed caused him to groan. "Though I
groane, I grumble not," said he to the by-standers,
and asked for a chaplain to come and pray for him.<note place="foot"><p>"A list of the particulars of what was lost on both sides in the

Three months later (2 Sept.) another contingent of

compounded for by payment of half that sum.
Parliament agreed to charge the excise with the
sum of £16,000 to provide compensation for any

<p>The aid of the City was now invoked by

On the 5th September the mayor and aldermen of
Plymouth addressed a letter to the mayor and
common council of London enclosing a petition they<pb n="221" /><anchor id="Pg221" />
were about to lay before parliament. The petition set
forth how, in the absence of Fairfax, who was laying
siege to Bristol, the whole country round Plymouth
was in the hands of the enemy; and an attack would,
it was feared, be soon made by Lord Goring on the
town garrison. Unless the siege was raised before
winter, or considerable supplies brought in, the town
would be unable to hold out longer. This petition
the municipal authorities of London were asked to
second, with the hope of prevailing upon parliament
to send at least that relief which had been so often
desired and so often promised. A whole fortnight
elapsed before the letter and petition were brought to
the notice of the Common Council (20 Sept.)—the
letter from Gloucester had taken a week in transit,
such was the state of the country—and then it was
resolved to send a deputation from the city, including
the two sheriffs, to express to the Committee of Both
Kingdoms the desire of the City that they would be
pleased to take the petition into speedy and serious
consideration, and to provide for the safety and

had been quartered on the city.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 141.</p></note> Now that the war

<note place="margin"><p>The Presbyterians and Independents.</p></note>

<p>The troubles with Charles had scarcely terminated
before a new struggle commenced. A monster had
been raised, after much hesitation and with no little
difficulty, in the shape of a well-organised and regularly
paid army, the command of which was virtually in
the hands of a small political party known as
Independents. The great fear was lest this party,
with the army at its back, should over-ride the wishes
of the Presbyterians, a party which was numerically
stronger than the Independents, both in the House
and in the country; and to avoid such a catastrophe
the Presbyterians of England were ready to join hands
with their brethren in Scotland.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Presbyterians and the Scottish army.</p></note>

<p>The House, however, was unfortunate enough at
this critical juncture to offend the Scots as well as the
citizens of London. The Scottish army had been
invited to march southward to attack Newark, whither
Charles had betaken himself after witnessing from the
walls of Chester the defeat of his troops on Rowton
Heath (24 Sept.), and the Commons had promised to
raise a sum of £30,000 for its pay provided it arrived

<p>The quarrel between parliament and the City
was scarcely less serious, and arose out of an attempt
to foist a system of Presbyterianism upon the citizens
which should serve as a model for the rest of the
kingdom. It was not that the Londoner objected
to the principle of Presbyterianism; the natural bent
of his mind was in that direction, and the City had
already petitioned parliament for the election of
elders to join with the parish ministers.<note place="foot"><p>Whitelock, p. 136.</p></note> What he
found fault with was the mode of electing the elders

so far from satisfying the general body of citizens that
a number of them presented a petition to the Common

view to having the powers of the elders sufficiently
enlarged to effect a genuine reform in the Church.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 153b; Journal House of Lords, vii, 717.</p></note> They
wanted, in fact, to see parliamentary control over the

they so desired.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 151b-153; Journal House of Lords, vii, 714-717.</p></note> It was a difficult matter on which

a deputation of aldermen and common councillors,
of whom Alderman Gibbs acted as spokesman,
presented themselves (19 Nov.) before the House of
Commons with the petition of the citizens, as well as
with the "desires and reasons" of the city clergy.
The reply they got was far from encouraging. They
were given to understand that parliament was well
aware of its trust and duty, and was quite able to
discharge both, if only it was let alone, and its purpose
not misconceived and prejudged as it appeared to
have been in the city; and they were dismissed with
the caution not to form premature opinions about
matters which were still under discussion.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 154b; Journal House of Commons, iv, 348.</p></note> Notwithstanding
this rebuff, the deputation the following day
attended before the Lords (20 Nov.), who returned
them a far more gracious and sympathetic answer.
After thanking the deputation for their expressions of
submission to the resolutions of parliament, their
lordships assured them that none should excel them
in their endeavours for the maintenance of the
covenant, the advancement and settling of God's

<p>In the meantime a deputation from parliament
had waited on the Common Council (12 Nov.) with a
request for a loan of £6,000 for the troops engaged
in blockading Chester. The court agreed to the
request, but thought it high time to learn precisely
how the city stood with respect to loans already made

<p>It was feared that the Scottish army might

seen, had agreed with parliament to advance a sum
of £30,000 for payment of the Scots, provided their
army appeared before Newark by the 1st November.
This condition had not been fulfilled. The army,
nevertheless, appeared later on, and a committee of the
House of Commons came down to the city and asked
the citizens (6 Dec.) to stand by their former promise

<p>The question with Charles was, from whom was
he likely to obtain the better terms, the English or the
Scots? On the 26th December he addressed a letter
to the Speaker of the House of Lords, asking whether
the two Houses of Parliament, the Scottish commissioners,
the municipal authorities, as well as the
militia of the city and the officers of both armies,
would guarantee his personal security if he came to
reside in London or Westminster, with a retinue not
exceeding three hundred in number, for a period of
forty days.<note place="foot"><p>Letter from the king at Oxford to the Speaker of the House of

great. Already the Earl of Holland had been heard
to threaten a royalist rising in the city if only

<p>The day following the despatch of this reply was
kept in the city as a day of solemn humiliation.
Sermons were preached before the mayor, aldermen
and members of the common council, who afterwards
individually took the oath and covenant. An enquiry
was subsequently ordered (9 Feb.) for the purpose of
discovering what members of the common council
had failed to take the covenant on this occasion, and
the reasons why they had not done so. A few
members stood out and refused to renew the covenant,
whereupon the court resolved to ask parliament for
instructions as to what should be done with them.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 160, 166b, 174.</p></note></p>

<p>On the 15th January Charles made overtures to

settled as it was in the reign of Elizabeth and James,
"with full liberty for the ease of their consciences
who will not communicate in that service established
by law, and likewise for the free and public use of
the directory prescribed and, by command of the

<note place="margin"><p>The City's petition against toleration, 15 Jan.</p></note>

<p>This important concession on the part of Charles—a
concession which only the necessities of the time
induced him, after much exercise of mind, to make—was
announced to parliament on the same day that
the City presented a petition<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 160b; Journal House of Lords, viii, 105.</p></note> against toleration of any
other form of religion than the Presbyterianism
already adopted by parliament and the citizens. The
petitioners declared that since they last addressed
the Houses on the subject of religion a fresh election
of the Common Council had taken place, and the
inhabitants of many of the wards had taken the
opportunity of asking their alderman that parliament
might be again desired to settle Church
government and forbid toleration. Private meetings
for religious worship, they went on to say, were
constantly held. In one parish there were at least
eleven. Orthodox ministers were evil spoken of, as
if the city were still under the "tyranny of prelatical
government." Women had taken to preaching, and
such blasphemies were uttered as made the petitioners
tremble to think of. Having heard that it was the
intention of divers persons to petition the House for
a toleration of such doctrines as were against the
covenant under pretext of liberty of conscience, the
petitioners humbly prayed that parliament would
take steps to remedy abuses and to settle the Church
government according to the solemn covenant made
with the most high God. The Commons lent a ready
ear to the petition and thanked the City for their
display of piety and religion. It was gratifying to
them to know that they had the sympathy of the
City in their anxiety to settle the peace of the<pb n="228" /><anchor id="Pg228" />
Church.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 166; Journal House of Commons, iv, 407.</p></note> The Lords, to whom a similar petition had

<p>Whilst endeavouring to come to terms with
parliament Charles was also in communication both
with the Scots and the Independents. His purpose
was to play one party off against the other. A
complete understanding existed between the citizens
and the Scots on the subject of religion. On the
11th February the Scottish commissioners themselves
appeared at a Common Council bearing a letter from
the president of the Scottish parliament addressed to
the lord mayor, aldermen and common council of
the city, thanking them for their zeal for the
reformation of religion and uniformity of Church
government, as well as for the large sums of money
advanced to the armies in defence of religion and the
liberty of the subject.<note place="foot"><p>Letter dated 27 Jan.—Journal 40, fo. 170.</p></note> The Common Council thanked
the commissioners for the favour thus shown, and

of religion and uniformity of Church government, and
would persevere in its resolution to preserve the same
according to the covenant.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Parliament desires to know particulars of the interview.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>Francis Allen's account of the interview.</p></note>

<p>As soon as Parliament heard that the City had
received a communication from Scotland the Commons
sent a deputation to learn all the particulars and to
ask that the letter might be forwarded to them. The
deputation was to assure the mayor and the Common<pb n="229" /><anchor id="Pg229" />
Council that there was "no jealousie at all or dislike
of their proceedings" in the business. In the meanwhile
the House called upon Francis Allen, a member
of the House as well as a member of the Common
Council, to give an account of what had taken place
in the city on the 11th. This he did to the best of his
ability, giving from memory the substance of the letter
from Scotland. He then proceeded to say that one
of the Scottish commissioners, Lord Lauderdale, had
made the following remark before the Common
Council, viz., "That many aspersions had been caste
upon their armie and their proceedings by malignants;
and desired that the authors of them might be
looked upon as those that endeavour to disturb the
unitie of both kingdomes."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 170b, 171; Journal House of Commons, iv, 437,

<note place="margin"><p>The City's version of the matter.</p></note>

<p>That at least was the story as recorded in the
Journal of the House. Allen, however, declared that
he had been inaccurately recorded, and the Common
Council, in giving parliament their own version of the
matter, denied that Lauderdale had made any such
remark. He had said nothing that could give offence.
They forwarded the letter as desired, but begged that
it might be returned in order that it might be entered
on the city's Journal. They further expressed a wish
to print and publish it so that the real facts might be
known. Allen, they said, was not to be credited, and
had been guilty of a breach of privilege in what he
had done.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 171-173.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Resolution of the House. 21 Feb., 1646.</p></note>

<p>The House, however, took a different view of
Allen's conduct, and declared that he had only done<pb n="230" /><anchor id="Pg230" />
his duty. It at the same time came to a resolution
that the relation entered on the Journal of the House
varied from Allen's and ordered it to be expunged.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 449.</p></note></p>

of the ward of Farringdon Without, the House
declared (5 Dec, 1649) that it deemed it "an acceptable
service to the commonwealth" if Allen would
accept the post, and the Common Council resolved
(19 Dec.) to revoke all votes of the court that had
been passed in the month of February, 1646, reflecting

<p>Hitherto the City and Parliament had, in the
presence of a common danger, mutually supported one
another; but as soon as the royalists ceased to give
further cause for alarm differences immediately sprang
up. The question of the City's jurisdiction over the
militia raised within the weekly bills of mortality, as
well as over that raised within the city and liberties,
was no new question. It had been raised at least
as far back as August, 1644,<note place="foot"><p>It had been one of the twenty-eight propositions (afterwards
reduced to six) made to parliament in that month.</p></note> but during the crisis of
the civil war the matter had been allowed to drop

forward and urged parliament to acknowledge its
jurisdiction.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 156, 156b.</p></note> Before parliament would give its assent
it wished to be informed whether the jurisdiction
claimed by the City was already vested in the City

jurisdiction was it that the City now desired?<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 157b, 158, 159.</p></note> The<pb n="231" /><anchor id="Pg231" />
chief opposition came from the inhabitants of Middlesex,
Surrey, Southwark and Westminster, who
objected to their militia being placed under the
command of the mayor, aldermen and common
council of the city. All parties were cited to
appear before the Star Chamber on the 31st June,
1646, to support their own contention.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 161b.</p></note> Parliament
had already (27 Jan.) expressed itself as willing to
sanction the government of the militia of the city
and liberties being vested in the municipal authorities
and to allow that the city forces should not be called
upon to serve away from the city without their own
consent,<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 420.</p></note> but this was not enough. What the City
desired was nothing more and nothing less than what
had already been proposed to the king at Oxford
with the sanction of both Houses, namely, "the
government of the militia of the parishes without
London and the liberties within the weekly bills
of mortality." Parliament had made no scruple
about the matter at a time when it stood in sore need
of assistance from the City; and the City did not
intend to let it go back lightly on its word.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 162b, 163b-165b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's petition to parliament, 6 Feb., 1646.</p></note>

<p>A petition was accordingly presented to the
House of Commons by alderman Fowke on the 6th
February.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 167b-169.</p></note> The petition set out at considerable length
all the proceedings that had taken place since the
question of the militia was first submitted to Charles.
It compared the attitude of the city towards parliament
in the late civil war with the part played by the
citizens in a previous civil war, viz., the war of<pb n="232" /><anchor id="Pg232" />
the Barons, when (according to the petitioners) the
Barons were eventually beaten out of the field owing
to the citizens of London staying at home! The
petitioners proceeded to show the necessity of the
City being empowered to raise militia in the adjacent
counties for the purpose of keeping open a passage
for victualling the city in times of danger; that
since the militia of the suburbs had been under the
command of the City good service had been rendered
to the parliamentary cause, and notably in the relief
of Gloucester; that if it were now removed from the
jurisdiction of the City the suburban forts might be
seized and both the city and parliament might be
threatened; and that it was for the better preservation
of parliament, and not for the purpose of rendering
the city militia independent of parliament, that the
petitioners appeared before the House. Finally,
Alderman Fowke, who acted as spokesman, declared
himself authorised to state that if the militia of the
city and kingdom were not settled by the king and
parliament there would be no course left open to the
city authorities but to act according to their conscience
and to abide by their covenant. A similar petition
was presented to the House of Lords (7 Feb.). A
week later (14 Feb.) a counter-petition was addressed
to the Commons by the inhabitants of the Tower
Hamlets, Westminster and Southwark,<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 441.</p></note> and on the
13th March a committee was appointed to arrange, if
possible, a compromise.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 474.</p></note></p>

a system of Presbyterianism throughout England.<note place="foot"><p>5 March, 1646.—Journal House of Commons, iv, 463.</p></note>
One clause of this ordinance—clause 14—was particularly
objectionable as introducing the authority of
the State into matters of Church government. Commissioners
were to be appointed, of whom nothing
was known, to regulate the Church in each province.
The Common Council, being urged by inhabitants of
the city to oppose a measure so opposed to the Word
of God,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 173b, 174b.</p></note> presented petitions to both Houses (to the
Lords first, they having not yet assented to clause 14)
praying that no officers might be appointed to exercise
any Church censures contrary to the Scriptures, and
that their appointment might be in accordance with
the Word of God.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 174, 174b.</p></note> The petitions were so badly
received by both Houses that the municipal authorities
took fright, and asked that they might be withdrawn
and expunged from the Journals of Parliament. Their
request was acceded to, but only on condition that the
petitions were likewise expunged from the City's
Records.<note place="foot"><p>19 March, 1646.—Journal House of Commons, iv, 479.</p></note></p>

<p>The reconciliation between parliament and the
city was followed by an interchange of courtesies.
The royalist army under Hopton had recently
surrendered to Fairfax in the west of England
(14 March), and had been disbanded; and the last
hope of Charles had vanished in the defeat of Astley's
troops after a sharp engagement at Stow-on-the-Wold
(22 March). "You have now done your work" were
the parting words of the veteran commander to his<pb n="234" /><anchor id="Pg234" />
soldiers, "and may go play, unless you will fall out
among yourselves."<note place="foot"><p>Rushworth, vi, 141.</p></note> On the 26th March a deputation
from both Houses waited on the Common Council,
and invited the mayor, aldermen and council, as "the
representative body of the city," to attend a public
thanksgiving service to be held that day week (2 April)
at Christ Church, Newgate Street. The invitation was
graciously accepted, and the City returned the compliment
by asking both Houses to dine the same
day at Grocers' Hall.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 175b.</p></note></p>

<p>On the 19th May, whilst virtually a prisoner in
the hands of the Scots, Charles wrote to the City<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 183; Rushworth, vi, 275; Journal House of Lords,

declaring his readiness to concur in settling truth and
peace, his desire to have all things speedily concluded
to that end, and his hope that his return to his ancient
city might be to the satisfaction of parliament and his
people. The Commons were angry with the civic
authorities for opening the king's letter without their
leave, and returned a curt answer to a remonstrance
presented to them by the City calling upon them to
suppress heresy, to unite with the Scots and to come
to a speedy arrangement with the king.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 555.</p></note> The Lords,
to whom a similar remonstrance had been presented,
expressed themselves more graciously. They acknowledged
the fidelity and constant services of the City to
parliament. They were satisfied with the resolutions
of the citizens to settle the Protestant religion and to
preserve the rights and privileges of parliament, the
liberties of the kingdoms and the person and authority<pb n="235" /><anchor id="Pg235" />
of his majesty. As for their lord mayor (Thomas
Adams), whose character the petitioners had declared
to have been aspersed by certain members of the
Commons (for opening the king's letter without
leave?), they (the Lords) held him in high esteem,
and declared that nothing had been said or done in
their House to his prejudice. As soon as they should
be informed of the nature of his grievance they would
be found ready in a parliamentary way to do him
right.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 183b; Journal House of Lords, viii, 334.</p></note> The Common Council received a formal

<note place="margin"><p>Disaffected citizens and the remonstrance.</p></note>

<p>On the other hand an attempt was made to
minimise the effect of the remonstrance by getting up
a counter-petition on the pretext that the remonstrance
had not fairly represented the wishes of the majority
of the citizens. This counter-petition, which is said to
have been backed up with 5,000 or 6,000 signatures,
was duly presented to the Commons, who by a small
majority passed a vote of thanks to the petitioners
(2 June).<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 561; Whitacre's Diary, Add.

<p>In the meanwhile the king's letter of the 19th May
remained unanswered. At last, on the 3rd July, an
answer—or "petition"—was drafted and submitted
to the Common Council for approval. After acknowledging
the special favour of receiving a letter direct
from the king, the citizens expressed their desire to<pb n="236" /><anchor id="Pg236" />
assure his majesty and the whole world of the
continuance of their loyalty in accordance with the
terms of their protestation and covenant. They
prayed him to comply with the propositions for the

of the union of the two nations which parliament was
about to send him, and they expressed an earnest
hope to see him return to his ancient city with honour

<note place="margin"><p>The leave of parliament asked before despatching the City's answer, 4 July, 1646.</p></note>

<p>The city fathers were too wary to despatch their
petition without first obtaining leave from parliament.
On the following day (4 July), therefore, a deputation of
aldermen and members of the council, with Alderman
Sir Thomas Foote at its head, presented itself before
the House of Lords to ask their leave to despatch the
City's answer to the king. After perusing the petition
the Lords declared their approval of its being sent to
the king, and courteously acknowledged the action of
the citizens in first submitting it to the judgment of
their lordships.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, viii, 411; Journal 40, fo. 188.</p></note> It was otherwise with the Commons,
who again returned a churlish reply. The deputation
was given to understand that the House had been
put to some inconvenience in giving them an audience,
being busily engaged at the time in pressing business.
The petition, however, was of importance, and would
receive their consideration at a convenient time.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 602.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Commons refuse leave, 11 July.</p></note>

<p>On Friday the 10th the Commons were pressed
for an answer, but they again put the matter off on
the plea of pressure of business. The next day the
deputation again waited on the House, attended by<pb n="237" /><anchor id="Pg237" />
the city members of parliament, and about four
o'clock in the afternoon received a message from the
Commons that the City's petition was not to be
forwarded to the king, and that "in convenient time"
they would send and inform the Common Council of
their further pleasure. Accordingly two of the city's
members, Sir Thomas Soame and Samuel Vassall,
appeared before the council on the 15th, when
Vassall declared that he had been commanded by
the House to make an explanation. In order to avoid
mistakes he would read the message he was to deliver.
The message was to the effect that inasmuch as
the propositions which had been despatched to the
king by parliament on the 13th June embraced the
city of London as well as the whole kingdom, the
House could not approve of the city's petition being
forwarded to his majesty. Being desired by the
council to leave the paper with them, Vassall declared
that he had no authority to do so.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 189; Journal House of Commons, iv, 615.</p></note> In the meantime,
the House had appointed a committee to
enquire "concerning the first principal contrivers and
framers of the city remonstrance, and concerning
such as have or do labour to disaffect the people and
the city from the parliament";<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, iv, 616.</p></note> but before the committee
could take steps to carry out its instructions,
circumstances had arisen which made it advisable
to let the matter drop and not to widen the breach

<note place="margin"><p>The king's answer to the propositions for peace, 12 Aug., 1646.</p></note>

<p>On the 30th July the parliamentary commissioners
arrived in Newcastle for the purpose of laying before
Charles propositions for peace. Charles had already<pb n="238" /><anchor id="Pg238" />
become possessed of a copy, and had long since
made up his mind to reject them. The commissioners
had received positive orders to allow the king ten
days to give his assent, and if he failed to give his
assent within that time after their arrival they were
at once to return.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, viii, 423, 433.</p></note> The only reply which Charles
condescended to give was contained in a letter which
he handed to the commissioners on the 1st August.
The letter was read before the House on the 12th.
It contained little more than vague promises and a
request that he might be allowed to come to London
to discuss the propositions at length.<note place="foot"><p>Id., viii, 460.</p></note></p>

<p>The same day that the king's answer was read

was produced, in which they offered to
withdraw their forces from England upon payment of
expenses already incurred.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, viii, 461.</p></note> After a considerable

It only remained for parliament to raise the sum of
£200,000 needed for the first payment, and to whom
was it more natural that application should first be
made than to the City? A large deputation from
the Commons, including Cromwell himself, accordingly
waited on the Common Council (7 Sept.) to
ask it to consider ways and means for raising the
money. The committee to whom the matter was<pb n="239" /><anchor id="Pg239" />
referred lost no time. On the 9th it reported to
the court a scheme for raising the money on the
security of the excise and sale of the Bishops' lands,
the security to extend to previous loans. Parliament
accepted these terms, on the understanding that

<p>On the 10th December there was presented to

well affected freemen and covenant engaged cittizens
of the cittie of London," with a request that it
might be laid before parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 199.</p></note> This document,
after being revised by a committee appointed for the
purpose, was laid before the Commons on the 19th
December, together with a petition from the civic
authorities themselves, who similarly addressed themselves
to the House of Lords. The chief points on
which stress was laid were the disbandment of the
army, the suppression of heresy, the union of the two
kingdoms, the free election of members of parliament,
and the City's government of its own militia. As for
the "bringing home of his majesty," that was left to
the wisdom of both Houses, with the confidence that
they would preserve his majesty's royal person and
authority in defence of the true religion and liberties
of the kingdom according to the covenant.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 199b-203b.</p></note> Both

should not come within twenty-five miles of London.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 115.</p></note>
The City petitioned both Houses that it might be
disbanded, and that the Common Council might have
authority to make annual election of the members of
the city's militia. To those petitions gracious answers
were returned, the Lords declaring that they had
considered already a measure touching the city's
militia and had transmitted it to the Commons.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 207-210b</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Dispute between the Presbyterians in parliament and the army, March, 1647.</p></note>

<p>The army would in all probability have been
disbanded in due course, and all might have gone well
but for the high-handed treatment it received from
the Commons. It was proposed to ask the soldiers
after disbandment to volunteer for service in Ireland.
There were, however, considerable arrears of pay due
to them, and neither officers nor men would volunteer
until they had received some assurance from parliament
that they would be paid all that was due to
them. Instead of doing this parliament contented
itself with voting a sum of £200,000, not for satisfying
arrears of pay, but "for the service of England and
Ireland."<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 130.</p></note> The soldiers were about to petition
parliament with the sanction of their officers, but
such a course was declared by both Houses to be

<note place="margin"><p>A city loan of £200,000, April, 1647.</p></note>

<p>It was easier for parliament to vote a sum of

as usual made to the City (6 April).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 212.</p></note> The zeal of the

the following day (17 April) the Common Council
was prepared with a scheme to be submitted to
parliament for raising the money. Like other schemes
that had gone before, it proposed that subscribers to
certain former loans should add arrears of interest,
and by making a further advance equivalent to the

of lands of bishops and delinquents.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo 214. The scheme is printed at length in Journal

the loan, but afterwards consented to a moiety of all
such compositions being added to the security.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 216-217 <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">et seq.</foreign>; Journal House of Commons,

<index index="toc" level1="A new City Militia Committee." /><note place="margin"><p>Nomination of the new militia committee, 27 April, 1647.</p></note>

<p>The appointment of the new militia committee
was made a solemn business by the citizens. Tuesday,
the 27th April, was fixed for the nomination, which
was preceded by prayer and a sermon in the church
of St. Laurence Jewry, and a formal renewal of the
covenant by all present. Thirty-one persons, the
number prescribed by the ordinance, were nominated,
all of them Presbyterians. Of these seven were
aldermen. On the 4th May both Houses signified
their approval of the city's nominees, and ordained
that any nine of them, whereof three were to be<pb n="242" /><anchor id="Pg242" />
aldermen and six to be commoners, should thenceforth
constitute a committee for the militia to order and
direct the same according to the true meaning and
intent of the ordinance recently passed.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 215, 215b; Journal House of Lords, ix, 175.</p></note></p>

<p>One of the first acts of the new committee was
to ask leave of parliament to raise an additional sum
of £20,000 to satisfy the arrears due to the city's
forces that had been engaged in guarding the Houses
of Parliament, the Tower and forts within the lines of
communication around the city. Parliament only
consented, however, to the sum of £12,000 being
raised for this purpose.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 217(a)b; Journal House of Commons, v, 188.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Parliament beset by disbanded soldiers, 7 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>The re-modelling of the city force to the exclusion
of everyone tainted with independency only served
to increase the discontent of the army. It was bad
enough to find the Presbyterians in parliament
joining hands with the Presbyterians in the city
against the army; it was worse if the city trained
bands were to receive their arrears of pay whilst the
army was left out in the cold. An attempt was made
to bring pressure to bear on parliament by a mob of
reformadoes or disbanded soldiers besetting the House
of Commons on the 7th June. These men clamoured
for their arrears of pay and refused to go away unless
the sum of £10,000 should be voted for them.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>City petition to parliament, 8 June.</p></note>

<p>On the following day (8 June) the City presented
another petition to parliament praying that the army
might be paid off as speedily as possible; that the
king, who had recently been carried off from Holmby
House by a troop of cavalry under Joyce, might be<pb n="243" /><anchor id="Pg243" />
disposed of in such a way as to allow the parliaments
of England and Scotland free access to him; and thirdly
that, seeing the danger of the times, an ordinance of
the 17th January, 1645, authorising the City to raise
cavalry in their own defence and to apprehend disaffected
persons, might be revived. The House,
which was guarded at the time by a city regiment,
could scarcely do otherwise than comply with the
prayer of the petitioners.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 218b, 219; Journal House of Commons, v, 202,

<index index="toc" level1="The City and the Parliamentary Forces." /><note place="margin"><p>Letter from the army to the city, 11 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>Three days later (11 June) a letter was brought
to the city by "two messengers that looked like
soldiers," signed by Fairfax and twelve others,
informing the civic authorities of the army's approach
to London.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 219-220; Journal House of Commons, v, 208;
Rushworth, vi, 554.</p></note> The City was asked to believe that such
action on the part of the army was only directed
against those who were endeavouring to engage
the kingdom in a new war. As Englishmen, if not
as soldiers, the writers desired only "the peace
of the kingdom and liberty of the subject, according
to the votes and declarations of parliament."
They desired no alteration of the civil government,
nor to hinder Presbyterianism. When once
the State had settled a matter there was nothing for it
but to submit or suffer; they only wished that every
good citizen and every peaceful man might be allowed
to enjoy liberty. "These, in brief," continued the
writers, "are our desires, and the things for which we
stand, beyond which we shall not go; and for obtaining
these things we are drawing near your city,
professing sincerely from our hearts we intend not<pb n="244" /><anchor id="Pg244" />
evil toward you; declaring with all confidence and
assurance that if you appear not against us in these
our just desires to assist that wicked party that
would embroil us and the kingdom, nor we nor our
soldiers shall give you the least offence." It was
true, they went on to say, that a rich city like London
offered a tempting bait for poor hungry soldiers, but
the officers would protect it with their last drop of
blood from the soldiery provided no provocation were
offered by the citizens themselves. Their men valued
their own high character above any wealth, and the
citizens would act like fellow subjects and brethren by
using their influence with parliament on their behalf.
On the other hand, "if after all this you, or a considerable
part of you, be seduced to take up arms in
opposition to or hindrance of these our just undertakings,
we hope by this brotherly premonition, to
the sincerity thereof we call God to witness, we have
freed ourselves from all that ruin which may befall
that great and populous city, having thereby washed
our hands thereof."</p>

<note place="margin"><p>A new Committee of Safety, 11 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>This letter was laid before the House with a
request that it would endeavour to prevent Fairfax
quartering his army on the city, thereby enhancing
the price of provisions, and this request was acceded
to. At the same time a new committee of safety,
composed of members of both Houses, was appointed
to join the reformed Committee of Militia of the
city in taking all necessary steps to secure "the safety
of the parliament and the city."<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 207; Journal House of Lords,
ix, 255.</p></note> The committee
established itself at the Guildhall and commenced<pb n="245" /><anchor id="Pg245" />
preparing lists of disbanded officers willing to serve
the parliament.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's answer to the letter from the army, 12 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>The City in the meantime drafted a reply<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 221; Rushworth, vi, 557.</p></note> of its
own, and this was despatched to the army on the
12th, after receiving the approval of the House. In
it the City disavowed any animosity towards the
army. The citizens had only put themselves into a
state of defence against unlawful violence. So far
were they from opposing the just demands of the
army, they had themselves presented a humble
address to parliament that these might be granted.
If the officers would only keep the army at a
distance of thirty miles from London, and so give
no occasion for disorder or rise in the price of
victuals in the city, it would go far to prove the
sincerity of the intentions expressed in their letter.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Answer from Fairfax and his council of war at St. Albans, 15 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>This letter found the army at St. Albans. The
deputation that carried it thither returned with two
missives, one addressed to the commissioners of the
city of London and the other to the mayor, aldermen
and Common Council.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 222, 222b.</p></note> In the first Fairfax and the
"council of war" declared the utter impossibility of
removing the army to a distance of thirty miles from
London so long as enlistments were being made in
the city and suburbs in addition to the usual trained
bands and auxiliaries. A stop must be put to this,
otherwise the army would have to take the matter in
hand. In the second the officers informed the civic
authorities that the movements of the army would
greatly depend upon the action parliament took<pb n="246" /><anchor id="Pg246" />
with respect to certain "papers" now to be submitted
to it.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Declaration of the Army." /><note place="margin"><p><emph>The Declaration of the Army</emph> and the <emph>Charge</emph> against eleven members of the House, 15 and 16 June.</p></note>

<p>By "papers" the writers were referring to a
document styled <emph>The Declaration of the Army</emph>, which
had that morning been placed in the hands of the
parliamentary commissioners to be forwarded to the
Lords.<note place="foot"><p>The commissioners to Manchester, 15 June, 1647.—Journal House
of Lords, ix, 269.</p></note> This declaration sought to establish the right
of the army to speak in the name of the English
people, and demanded the banishment from office of
all who spoke ill of it. To this was added a further
demand, viz., the expulsion from the House of those
who had proved themselves unworthy of their seats.
This last demand was followed by a formal charge
laid in the name of the army against eleven members
of the House of Commons (of whom Glyn, the city's
Recorder, was one) of having prejudiced the liberties
of the subject, misrepresented the army and raised
forces for a new war.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The trained bands refuse to muster." /><note place="margin"><p>Ineffectual attempt to call out the trained bands, 12 June.</p></note>

<p>As matters turned out the army had little cause
to fear the enlistments that had taken place in the
city. An attempt had, it is true, been made to
increase the number of the militia, but it had met
with poor success. When it became known in the
city that the army was moving southward from
Royston something like a panic prevailed. The
trained bands were called out on pain of death and
shops ordered to be shut, Sir John Gayer, the lord
mayor, being especially active. But when the companies
appeared on parade they were found to be
lamentably deficient in numbers, "not ten men of
some companies appeared, and many companies none<pb n="247" /><anchor id="Pg247" />
at all but officers."<note place="foot"><p>News letter from London, 13 June.—Clarke Papers (Camd. Soc.,
New Series, No. 49), i, 133. This attitude of the trained bands was a
serious affair, and called for a public declaration to be made for the
encouragement of citizens to respond to the call to arms for the safety
of parliament and the city.—Journal 40, fo. 224.</p></note> The whole affair was treated
as a farce by the on-lookers, who jeered at the troops
as they passed; and those who had shut up their
shops at the mayor's command soon opened them
again. It was clear that the citizens had no intention
of being engaged in a "new war." Parliament, finding
this to be the case, annulled the order for enlistments
and resolved that "the city might upon occasion send
letters to the army, so as they did first present them
to the House for their approbation."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 223, 223b.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Protracted correspondence between the City and Fairfax." /><note place="margin"><p>Letter from the City to Fairfax and the council of war, 18 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>By the 18th June the City was ready with its
reply to the last letters of Fairfax and the council of
war. This reply had after some hesitation received
the sanction of the Commons, and the City was to be
thenceforth permitted to correspond with the army
on its own responsibility, and without submitting its
letters first to parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 224b. The original reply not meeting with the
approval of the House, another was submitted on the following day, and
at last the City was allowed to send such answers as it thought fit.—Journal
House of Commons, v, 216, 217; Rushworth, vi, 577.</p></note> It entirely disavowed any
privity or consent of the Common Council in connection
with the recent enlistments other than those
of the trained bands and auxiliaries. All such enlistments
Fairfax was assured had now been stopped,
the civic authorities having intervened as requested.
The City's readiness to conform to the wishes of the
army would, it was hoped, draw forth a fuller assurance
that the army intended no prejudice either to parliament
or to the city, which had expended so much<pb n="248" /><anchor id="Pg248" />
blood and treasure in its defence, and that it would
remove its quarters farther from London.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 224-225b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Reply of Fairfax and council of war, 21 and 22 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>This reply did not give unqualified satisfaction.
It was impossible, wrote Fairfax and the council of
war (21 June),<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 225b, 226.</p></note> to remove the army farther from
London until parliament should have given a satisfactory
reply to the <emph>Humble Representation of the
dissatisfaction of the Army</emph>, the <emph>Declaration of the
Army</emph>, and the <emph>Charge</emph> made against eleven members
of the House of Commons. That the City had done
its part in stopping enlistments they readily acknowledged,
but information had reached them of underhand
workings still going on to enlist men, as a "foundation
for a new armie and a new warre." The letter concluded
with a reiteration of the writers' intention to
do nothing prejudicial to the parliament or the city,
for which they professed "a most tender regard." To
this letter a postscript was added the following day
(22 June) to the effect that since writing the above
they had heard that parliament had been again
threatened by a mob of reformadoes. It was therefore
more necessary than ever to preserve the remnant
of liberty that attached to the House.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="City Commissioners sent to the Army." /><note place="margin"><p>Commissioners from  the city to remain at headquarters, 24 and 25 June.</p></note>

<p>On the 23rd another letter<note place="foot"><p>Only the commencement of the letter is set out in the city's

desiring that some representatives of the city might
take up permanent quarters with the army until
matters became more settled. Accordingly, on the
following day (24 June) the Common Council
appointed Alderman Warner, Deputy Pack and<pb n="249" /><anchor id="Pg249" />
Colonel Player to go to Fairfax and the army and
remain with them until further orders. They were
to give his excellency and the council of war an

and assure them that the City would take good
care that both Houses should be allowed to conduct
their affairs in peace and quiet.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 227, 228. On the 25th the number of commissioners

<p>As soon as the commissioners arrived in camp
they were informed that the army was about to
change its quarters to Uxbridge. On the 25th
Fairfax again took occasion in a letter to the City,
dated from Berkhampstead,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 230.</p></note> to enlarge upon the
danger that was likely to arise from continued attempts
to raise forces in Wales, "besides underhand workings
in your city," and from parliament being threatened
by the presence of reformadoes. It could not
be expected that the kingdom would be safe, or
justice done, so long as the accused members sat as
judges. "We have written this to you," the letter
concluded, "for your satisfaction that so nothing may
be done without giving you a perfect account of our
intentions and ends, and still to continue our
assurance to you that should necessity bring us
nearer to the city our former faith given you shall
be observed inviolably, there being nothing more
(next the good of the kingdom) in our thoughts and
desires than the prosperity of your city." It was
six o'clock in the evening when this letter was
brought to the Common Council, so that there was
only time to acknowledge its receipt in a letter,<pb n="250" /><anchor id="Pg250" />

<note place="margin"><p>Withdrawal of the eleven members, 26 June, 1647.</p></note>

<p>As far as the removal of the objectionable
members of the House went Fairfax soon had his
way. For, notwithstanding the Commons having
declared on the 25th that they saw no valid reason
for suspending the members, the members themselves
solved the difficulty on the following day by asking
leave of absence, which the House was willing enough
to grant.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 225.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's petition to parliament to remove reformadoes, etc., 2 July.</p></note>

<p>The bands of reformadoes which infested the
city presented a greater difficulty. On the 2nd July
the City once more addressed itself to parliament in
the form of a petition suggesting a remedy for this
grievance, and although the petition reflected strongly
upon the mismanagement of affairs by the government,
and ventured to prescribe rules for its better
regulation, it was more favourably received than
others of a far less bold character had formerly been.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 231b-233; Journal House of Commons, v, 231;
Rushworth, vi, 597-600.</p></note>
The temper of the House must indeed have changed
when it could listen calmly to charges of malversation
of money collected for the disbandment of the army,
and to such advice as that parliament should "improve
its time" and busy itself only with such laws
as might settle the government of the Church, secure
the people from unlawful and arbitrary power, and
restore his majesty to his just rights and authority,
according to the covenant. A few months ago any
deputation that dared to address the House in these<pb n="251" /><anchor id="Pg251" />
terms would have been sharply dismissed. Times
had changed; and now, instead of a rebuke, the
City received thanks for its "constant very good
affections," and a day was appointed for taking the
petition into consideration.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Letter of Fairfax to the City setting forth the obstacles to a peace, 8 July, 1647.</p></note>

<p>A week later (8 July) Fairfax wrote to the City from
Reading—whither he had removed the headquarters of
the army (3 July) upon certain concessions being made
by parliament—enclosing a copy of a paper which he
had forwarded to parliament setting forth the obstacles
which still stood in the way of a peaceful settlement,
viz., the continued presence of reformadoes in and
about London, as well of the army raised for Ireland
but not despatched there, and the non-expulsion from
the House of those members who had aided the king
against parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 234.</p></note> At length parliament gave way.

<p>Matters were not improved by the action of the
apprentices of London, who, like the rest of the
inhabitants, took sides with king or parliament.
Parliament had recently sanctioned a monthly holiday
to all apprentices. The first of these holidays fell on
Tuesday, the 13th July. Grateful for this concession,
a number of lads employed the day in presenting a
petition to the Commons calling upon them to uphold

power on the terms offered by him on the 12th May
last, viz., the abandonment of the episcopacy for
three years and the militia for ten. An endeavour
was made to enlist the support of the municipal
authorities to this engagement, but a letter from
Fairfax (23 July) soon gave them to understand that
the army looked on the matter as one "set on foot
by the malice of some desperate-minded men, this
being their last engine for the putting all into confusion

<p>On Saturday, the 24th July, the day after the
Lords had given their assent to the proposal touching
the militia, two petitions were presented to the
Common Council praying it to take steps for retaining
the militia in the hands of the city committee.<note place="foot"><p>One petition purported to come from "Divers young men, citizens
and others, apprentices of the city," and the other from "Divers well
affected citizens of the city of London."—Journal 40, fos. 236, 239,
239b.</p></note> Both
petitions were well received by the court, and a draft
of another petition from the court itself was at once
made for presentation to both Houses on the following
Monday, together with the petitions presented to the
court. The sheriffs and the whole court, or as many<pb n="254" /><anchor id="Pg254" />
of them as could go, with the exception of those
actually serving on the militia committee, were
ordered to carry the petitions to Westminster. When
Monday came an excited crowd of apprentices and
others followed the sheriffs and members of the
Common Council up to the very doors of the Houses.
The few Peers who were in attendance on that day
were soon brought to pass a resolution abrogating the
recent ordinance.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, ix, 355.</p></note> When the turn of the Commons
came they made a bolder stand. The consideration
of the petitions was frequently interrupted by cries
of "Vote! vote!" from the apprentices, who stood
at the open doorway with their hats on.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 258, 259; Whitelock, 260, 261;
Clarke Papers, i, 218.</p></note> Hostile
as the city was, the House had no means of restoring
order without its aid. The civic authorities showed
no particular haste in complying with a request
for assistance. The Common Council assembled in
the afternoon, but all it did was to agree that the
members present should adjourn in a body to Westminster
"and use their best endeavour by all gentle
ways and means possible they can to appease the
said multitude and to free the said House from
danger."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 240b.</p></note> At length, towards eight o'clock in the
evening, the Commons, worn-out and exhausted,
yielded to the pressure put upon them and repealed
the obnoxious ordinance, after which the mob was content
to obey the city councillors and quietly disperse.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="More correspondence with Fairfax." /><note place="margin"><p>Letter to Fairfax, 28 July, 1647.</p></note>

<p>The civic authorities having recovered its control
over the militia immediately began to put the city<pb n="255" /><anchor id="Pg255" />
in a posture of defence. In this it was assisted by
the apprentices offering their services, their lives and
fortunes against any power whatsoever that should
attack the city. The Common Council thanked
them for their good will, and desired them to
carry themselves in an orderly and regular way,
and endeavour to prevent disorder and tumult.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 240b.</p></note>
There were already rumours that the army had
broken up and was marching towards London. No
time was to be lost if the city was to be saved from
falling into its hands. The militia committee was
ordered to draw up a declaration in justification of all
that the civic authorities had done, whilst a letter
was sent (28 July) to Fairfax deprecating any attempt
by the army to "intermeddle" with the liberties or
privileges of the city or to interpose in the matter of
the militia, which should be used only in defence of
parliament and the city without giving occasion for
offence to anyone. He was assured that now the
government of the militia had become revested in the
city there would be no more disorder.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 242b.</p></note> The day on
which this letter was despatched had been set apart
by the civic authorities as a day of fasting and
humiliation. Three ministers were appointed to pray
and preach before the mayor, aldermen and common
council at the church of St. Michael Bassishaw that
God might turn away his wrathful indignation against
the city and the nation.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 236.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Letter from Fairfax, 29 July.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's reply.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime Fairfax had been informed of
the terrorism brought to bear upon parliament, and
wrote (29 July) from Bedford to the Common Council<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 243, 243b.</p></note><pb n="256" /><anchor id="Pg256" />
saying that, for his part, he looked upon them, being
in authority, as responsible to the kingdom for the
recent disturbances. The letter reached the council
at eleven o'clock at night. In spite of the lateness of
the hour an answer was drawn up<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 243b.</p></note> disclaiming any
responsibility for the riot at Westminster on the ground
that at the time the city was without a settled militia
and held no commission on which to act. So far
from having encouraged the tumult, as many of the
council had been reported to have done, they had
used their best endeavours to allay it. In conclusion
the council declared themselves unconscious of having
contributed to the interruption of the "hopeful way
of peace and settlement" mentioned in the general's
letter, and would accordingly rely upon God for His
protection over the city.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>£20,000 voted for the defence of the city, 29 July, 1647.</p></note>

<p>The time for negotiations had clearly passed
away, and there was no other recourse but to repel

voted (29 July) a sum of £20,000 on the security of
the city seal for the purposes of defence.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 243.</p></note> The

<note place="margin"><p>Meeting of parliament, 30 July.</p></note>

<p>When parliament re-assembled on the 30th the
Speakers of the two Houses and a number of members
failed to appear. New Speakers were immediately
appointed and the expelled members ordered to take
their seats. One of the first acts of the House was<pb n="257" /><anchor id="Pg257" />
to authorise the militia committee to seize all horses
within the lines of communication for the defence of
parliament and the City, and in accordance with the
City's request sent word to Fairfax not to approach
within thirty miles of London.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 243-244; Journal House of Commons, v, 259.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Massey appointed to the command of the city's forces, 31 July, 1647.</p></note>

<p>On the following day (31 July) the House
signified its assent to the appointment of Massey as
commander-in-chief of the city forces, in accordance
with the desire of the militia committee and the
Common Council, and informed a city deputation
that it had taken the precaution to secure the Block-houses
at Tilbury and Gravesend. On hearing this
some of the deputation expressed a hope that the
House would also see to Windsor Castle.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 244-246b; Journal House of Commons, v, 261.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>New commissioners sent to the army, 2 Aug.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>Their instructions.</p></note>

<p>The Common Council was getting more and
more anxious every day. Fairfax had disdained giving
any reply to their last letters, and the army was
known to have already advanced as near as Colnbrook.
On the afternoon of the 2nd August the council
resolved to send another letter to the general,
disclaiming any intention on the part of the city to
raise a new war. The delivery of this despatch was
entrusted to six aldermen and twelve commoners, who
were to remain with the army, in addition to the
commissioners previously appointed, and use every
means in their power to prevent any further bloodshed.
If Fairfax complained that the city was
engaged in raising a body of horse, they were
instructed to throw the responsibility on parliament.
If he objected to the drilling of reformadoes, it was<pb n="258" /><anchor id="Pg258" />
again the work of parliament and not of the militia
committee. If the commissioners were asked for
some assurance that the city would protect parliament
in future from all attacks, they were to say that the
city would do its best to protect not only the sitting
members, but all who should return to the House. If
objection was raised to the appointment of Massey,
it was to be laid to the sudden approach of the army.
Should any question arise as to the recent riot at
Westminster, the whole affair was to be ascribed to
the absence of any settled authority of the city militia;
and lastly, if the matter of the petition and engagement
was raked up, the commissioners were to say
that the city had not been the promoters.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 247.</p></note> Furnished
with these instructions, the commissioners set out for
the army, which they found the next day (3 Aug.)
drawn up on Hounslow Heath.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>A declaration by the army, 3 Aug., 1647.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime another declaration<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 248-250b.</p></note> had been
prepared by Fairfax and the council of war recapitulating
the course affairs had taken, the changes
that had taken place in the government of the city
militia, the pressure that had been put upon parliament
resulting in the Speakers and many members being
driven away, and the continued presence of the eleven
members in the House after charges had been brought
against them, and signifying the intention of the army
to give a welcome to all members of parliament who
found themselves unable to take their seats at
Westminster with freedom and safety, and to regard
them as persons in whom the public trust of the
kingdom still remained. It was moreover the purpose
of the army to march on London, when it was<pb n="259" /><anchor id="Pg259" />
expected the eleven members would be either
delivered up or else kept in custody until they could
be brought to trial.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's reply to the declaration, 3 Aug., 1647.</p></note>

<p>As soon as the city commissioners arrived at headquarters
this declaration was put into their hands, and
with it they hurried back to London in time to lay
it before the Common Council the same afternoon.
The council was quick to discern that no other course
lay open to them but submission. A letter<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 250b.</p></note> was
accordingly despatched to Fairfax the same night, to
the effect that, as it appeared from the declaration
that the main object of the army drawing so near
London was to bring back to a free parliament at
Westminster those members who had withdrawn
owing to the tumult on the 26th July, the Common
Council heartily concurred therein, and no opposition
whatever would be shown to the troops appointed
to escort the members to Westminster. The City
declared itself ready to submit to parliament in everything,
and offered its entire force for its protection.
In order to remove all cause of offence or misunderstanding,
the City's own declaration<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 244b-246.</p></note> recently published
(30 July) was withdrawn. Under these circumstances
the council expressed a hope that the army would be
prevented from doing any offence or prejudice to the
city or the lines of communication.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Surrender of forts to Fairfax, 4 Aug.</p></note>

<p>The City was now all submission. On the 4th
August it agreed to a demand to surrender the forts
from "Giles Forte" down to the river-side, and the
Common Council wrote to Fairfax to that effect,
saying that "now, next unto Almighty God, we do<pb n="260" /><anchor id="Pg260" />
rely upon your excellencye's honourable word for
our safety, and to be protected from all violence of
the soldiery."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 251.</p></note> By that time Fairfax had arrived
with the army at Hammersmith, whence he wrote to
the City acknowledging their ready compliance in the
surrender of the forts, which he would shortly
garrison, and assuring them that the army would
behave itself in such a manner "as to witness to the
world the integrity of their hearts in having no other
design but the quiet and happy settlement of a firm
and lasting peace."<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 251b.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Army enters London." /><note place="margin"><p>The army enters London, 6 Aug., 1647.</p></note>

<p>On the 6th August the army entered the lines of
fortification and made its way to Westminster, accompanied
by the Speakers of both Houses and those
members who had betaken themselves to the army
after withdrawing from parliament. The civic
authorities, taking advantage of the hint offered them,
welcomed the army on its approach, the mayor and
aldermen going out as far as Hyde Park in coaches,
whilst the Common Council betook themselves to
Charing Cross by water, and there ranged themselves
in view of the soldiers as they passed.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 251b.</p></note> Glyn, the
Recorder, on whose behalf the City had already
addressed Fairfax, was instructed to make a speech
with the view of absolving the City from any implication

<p>On the following day (7 Aug.) the citizens made
a closer acquaintance with the army as it marched
through the heart of the city on its way to Croydon.
The words of Fairfax proved true. The troops
marched through the streets "with all civility, not<pb n="261" /><anchor id="Pg261" />
doing the least hurt or prejudice." The civic authorities
felt so much relief at seeing this unexpected maintenance
of discipline that they gave vent to their
feelings by asking Fairfax and all the officers to meet
them at dinner at Grocers' Hall on Thursday, the
13th, but that day proving inconvenient to the general,
who was busy settling the affairs of the army, the
dinner was ordered to be put off until the city should
again hear from him.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 252, 252b.</p></note> The termination of hostilities

was committed by parliament to Fairfax as constable.<note place="foot"><p>6 Aug.—Journal House of Commons, v, 269.</p></note>

those that remained to face the worst in England,
Glyn, the city's Recorder, was one. It was in vain

the aid of friends in both Houses on his behalf.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 251.</p></note> He

<p>On the 24th August a deputation of the committee
of the army waited on the Common Council
and demanded an advance of a month's pay
(£50,000). The City was to re-imburse itself out
of the arrears which the citizens had failed to
contribute to the army, and which amounted to
over £60,000. The matter was referred to a committee.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 254-254b.</p></note>
Ten days elapsed and parliament became
impatient for an answer.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, 3 Sept., v, 290.</p></note> The City was told (4 Sept.)
that its "engagement" of the 21st July had been the
occasion of the army approaching London, and its
failing to pay the money as it became due was the
occasion of keeping the army near London. If the
citizens failed to take the necessary steps for the
removal of the army, "they must expect to suffer the
inconveniences that will come hereby."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 255.</p></note> To this
the City replied (6 Sept.) that whatever arrears of
assessments were due they were not due from the
Common Council as a body, for that had never been
assessed, but were due from particular individuals.
The council feared that it would be impossible to<pb n="264" /><anchor id="Pg264" />
raise the money on the security offered, but it promised
to use its best endeavours to raise it if some
better security were found, and to get in arrears of
assessments at the same time. As to the "engagement,"
they called God to witness that the Common
Council as a body had had no hand in it; but as
soon as a copy of it was received from the army,
the council returned answer that "according to their
duty they did rest in that which both Houses
of Parliament had resolved hereupon." In that
resolution the council expressed itself as still remaining
and altogether disavowed the "engagement."
It even ventured to hope that the House would not
permit such a mark of its displeasure to remain on
record, reflecting so badly as it did upon the whole
City.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 255b, 256.</p></note></p>

<p>This reply being deemed unsatisfactory the
Commons sent a more peremptory demand (9 Sept.)
to the effect that not only the sum of £50,000 should
be advanced by the City before the 18th September,
but that also the whole of the arrears, amounting to
£64,000, should be levied,<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 298.</p></note> and they got Fairfax himself
to write and back up their demand for £50,000.
The letter of Fairfax was dated from Putney on the
6th September, but it was not communicated to the
Common Council until Saturday the 11th, a court
which had been specially summoned for the previous
day (Friday) having been adjourned for want of a

might be strengthened by additional parliamentary
powers.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 257; Journal House of Commons, v, 301.</p></note> To Fairfax a long letter was sent the same

to parliament, that unless the arrears came in by a

This withholding the money by the City, said they,
was but a scheme for bringing the army into disrepute,
and for the purpose of causing disturbance; the
Common Council had been ready enough to advance
far larger sums to encourage designs against parliament
and the army; it might again be induced to show a
similar readiness in providing money, without which
the army could not disperse, if parliament would but
impose a fine upon them as a body, "which money

<p>A letter from Fairfax, dated at Kingston the

on the city to assist the municipal authorities in
getting in arrears of assessments due to the army,
created no little alarm in the city. Whilst the
Common Council was deliberating on the matter
news was brought that the Earl of Northumberland
and a deputation from both Houses were waiting
without the Council Chamber desiring to speak with
some members of the court. A similar intimation to
that contained in the letter of Fairfax had been made<pb n="268" /><anchor id="Pg268" />
to parliament, and both Houses were anxious to urge
upon the city the extreme importance of anticipating
such a step as that which Fairfax threatened by
getting in the arrears of assessments as speedily
as possible. This the council expressed itself as
very willing to do if parliament would relieve the
collectors of certain pains and penalties recently
imposed on them, which had only served to render
them the more unwilling to execute their duties.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 260.</p></note></p>

should be the cause of the army continuing so long in
the vicinity of London, to the great prejudice if not to
the ruin of many. They were doing all they could
to get in the arrears, and they called the general's
attention to certain proposals which they were about
to submit to parliament. They concluded by assuring
Fairfax that the City was determined to remain faithful
to parliament and the kingdom, and at the same time
to cultivate good relations with the army.</p>

Court did away with the necessity of its presence in
the immediate neighbourhood of London, informing
the authorities that as parliament had raised an
objection to his sending troops to the city for the
purpose of getting in arrears, he was content to wait
and see the result of parliamentary action in the
matter and whether the City's recent promises bore
fruit or not. Should the result prove unsatisfactory,
he doubted not the consequences would be sad, "and
that not more to the parliament, kingdom or army

<p>On the 1st December Alderman Bide, who had
narrowly escaped impeachment with Gayer and the
rest, and who was now sheriff, presented a petition to
the Commons on behalf of the City. This petition,
which had been ordered to be prepared as far back as
the 6th November—that is to say, before Charles's
escape from Hampton Court and the withdrawal of
the army to Windsor—after expressing the City's
humble submission to parliament and its appreciation
of the many benefits it had derived from the course
which parliament had followed, prayed the House to<pb n="270" /><anchor id="Pg270" />
take steps for the removal of the army to a greater
distance from the city and for the strict observance
of the Covenant, and concluded by asking for the
release of their Recorder and of the aldermen recently
committed to prison.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 263.</p></note> The Journal of the House
records nothing more than the formal answer which
the Commons returned to the petition: their thanks
to the City for expressions of goodwill, their readiness
to consider such matters referred to in the petition as
had not been already taken in hand, and their assurance
that speedy justice should be done to those imprisoned.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 374; Journal 40, fo. 264.</p></note>
But from other sources it appears that the petition
created considerable ill-feeling in the House, and that it
was only after Vane had threatened to bring the army
back again that the petition was practically rejected.
Had the petitioners succeeded in their object it was
expected that the Presbyterians in parliament and in
the city would have followed up their victory by
restoring the expelled members and preparing for a

<p>The mayor, who owed his election to pressure
of parliament, and who was on that account never
really popular in the city, unwittingly assisted the
royal cause by another act of injudicious meddling.
On Sunday, the 9th April, 1648, he sent a detachment
of trained bands to interfere with the amusement of
some boys playing tip-cat in Moorfields. A crowd of
apprentices and others took the part of the boys, and
attacked the trained bands, getting possession of their
arms and colours. With these they marched, some
three or four thousand strong, along Fleet Street and
the Strand, raising the shout of "Now for King
Charles!" and intending to make their way to Whitehall,
but before they reached Charing Cross they were
scattered by a troop of cavalry quartered at the
King's Mews, and for a time the disturbance was at<pb n="272" /><anchor id="Pg272" />
an end. During the night, however, the apprentices
again arose and made themselves masters of Ludgate
and Newgate. Laying their hands on whatever
ammunition they could find, and summoning their
friends by drums belonging to the trained bands, they
proceeded to attack the mansion of the unpopular
mayor. Whilst a messenger was hurrying off to
Fairfax for military aid, the mayor, the sheriffs
and the Committee of Militia had to repel as best
they could the attacks of the mob, who kept firing
through the windows of the lord mayor's house. At
last the troops arrived, and were admitted into the
city by Aldersgate. They followed up the rioters to
the Leadenhall, where arms were being collected.
Resistance to a disciplined force soon proved useless.
The ringleaders were taken and led off to prison, and
the crowd was dispersed, but not without some little
bloodshed.<note place="foot"><p>Report to Common Council, 11 April.—Journal 40, fo. 267;

mayor and all others concerned for the part they had
taken in its suppression. A day was appointed for a
public thanksgiving for deliverance from the threatened
danger. The Tower garrison was augmented and the<pb n="273" /><anchor id="Pg273" />

danger, whilst a commission of Oyer and Terminer was
issued for the punishment of those implicated in the

<p>Six months and more had now passed since
Gayer, the late deposed mayor, and his brother
aldermen had been committed to prison, and no steps
had as yet been taken to bring them to trial. At
length articles of impeachment were drawn up by the
Commons and sent up to the Lords (15 April),<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, x, 201-203.</p></note>
charging him with having on the 26th July last past,
in conjunction with Thomas Adams, John Langham,
James Bunce, aldermen of the city and others,
"maliciously and traitorously plotted and endeavoured
with open force and violence, and with armed
power, to compel and enforce the Lords and Commons
then assembled in parliament at Westminster
to alter the laws and ordinances by parliament
established for the safety and weal of the realm;
and likewise maliciously and traitorously raised and
levied war against the king, parliament and kingdom."
Gayer took exception to the jurisdiction of the House,
and when brought before the Lords and ordered to
kneel at the bar as a delinquent refused to do anything
of the kind, for which contempt he was fined
£500. After hearing the articles of impeachment
read, he declared that he disavowed and abhorred the
offences with which he was charged, and asked to be
furnished with a copy of them. He further desired
the assistance of counsel and time to answer them,<pb n="274" /><anchor id="Pg274" />
both of which were allowed.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, x, 207, 208. </p></note> When his brother
aldermen and fellow prisoners appeared before the

Like Gayer they were severally fined<note place="foot"><p>Id., x, 231, 232.</p></note> and relegated
to the Tower, whence they had been brought. There
the four aldermen remained prisoners until a crisis
arrived in the following June, when the Commons,
fearing to alienate the city at a time when the enemy
was almost at its gates, declared (3 June) that they
would proceed no further with the charges.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 583, 584.</p></note> The

<p>In the meanwhile matters assumed a gloomy

The object for which this step was being taken
was declared to be the establishment of the Presbyterian
form of religion in England, the suppression of<pb n="275" /><anchor id="Pg275" />
heresy and the Book of Common Prayer, the disbandment
of Fairfax's army of sectaries, and the opening

<note place="margin"><p>Ill-feeling between the city and the army.</p></note>

<p>Matters were made worse by the continued
ill-feeling between the City and the English army,
whose pay was still largely in arrear. No threats of
Fairfax or of parliament had succeeded in making the
inhabitants of the city pay up their arrears of assessments,
and unless these were paid the soldiers had
no alternative but to starve or render themselves
obnoxious to the nation by living at free quarters.
The City had been already charged with withholding
money for the express purpose of driving the army to
the latter alternative, that so the nation might the
quicker be free of it. The army was fast losing
patience, and there was some talk of it taking the law
into its own hands.</p>

<p>On the 24th April the mayor informed the citizens
assembled in Common Council that he had received
information from one John Everard of certain matters
which the informer pretended to have overheard at
Windsor greatly affecting the city. He had examined
Everard on oath, and the result of the examination
being then openly read, it was resolved to lay the
same before parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 267b.</p></note> Accordingly, on the 27th,
Everard's information, which was nothing more nor
less than a threat which he had overheard some
officers make of disarming and plundering the city,<pb n="276" /><anchor id="Pg276" />
was laid before both Houses, together with a petition
from the municipal authorities that the chains which
had been recently removed from the streets of the
city by order of parliament might be restored for the
purpose of defence, that the army should be removed
to a greater distance, and that Skippon might be
placed in command of the city's forces.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 269, 270; Journal House of Commons, v, 546;

was nothing to be gained by opposing the city's
wishes in the matter of replacing the chains and the
appointment of Skippon, so that these concessions
were readily made, but the question of removing the
army could only be decided with the concurrence of
the army itself.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Charges against a member of the Common Council, 28 April, 1648.</p></note>

<p>A member of the Common Council, Philip Chetwyn,

both charges were allowed to drop. The council at
the same time passed a resolution to the effect that
whenever a charge should in future be made by one
member of the court against another, and the court
take cognisance of it, the charge itself and the names
of the accuser and the accused should be expressed in

<p>The City lost no time in availing itself of the
assent of parliament to replace the chains in the
streets from which they had been removed. They<pb n="277" /><anchor id="Pg277" />
went further than this. From Saturday night to the
following Monday night (28-30 May) the gates and
posterns were ordered to be kept closed and guarded,
the names of all lodgers were to be taken, vagrant
soldiers were to be ordered to their quarters, whilst
servants and children were to be confined indoors,
except on the Sunday that intervened, when they
might be escorted to church by their parents or
masters.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 270b, 271b.</p></note> The reason for these precautions was that
there had been unmistakable signs of the army getting
out of hand. An unexpected danger, the revolt of
the whole of South Wales, which meant nothing less
than the renewal of the war, served, however, to
consolidate the ranks.</p>

<p>With Wales up in arms for the king and the

the army had enough to do without keeping a forcible
hold on London. The City, therefore, had to be left
to itself, and to be kept in good humour by concessions
rather than by force until the trouble had passed away.
The story goes that before Cromwell proceeded to
quell the rebellion in Wales the Council of War
resolved that the City should have all they asked or
desired, "there being no other way for the present to
quiet them." It would be time enough when the enemy
had been beaten to "make the City pay for all."<note place="foot"><p>This remark is credited to Cromwell, but as Dr. Gardiner ("Hist.

quartered at Whitehall and Charing Cross, leaving the
protection of parliament to the London forces under
the command of Skippon. The same day that the
Commons received this letter (2 May) they communicated
with the Common Council of the city, who were
delighted at the execution of their long expressed
wishes that the army should be removed from the
vicinity of London and at the compliment paid them
by Fairfax in placing the protection of parliament in
their hands. The sum of £600 a year was voted to
Skippon for his services, a sum just double that
allowed him on his appointment as sergeant-major-general
in January, 1642.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 272b; Journal House of Commons, v, 549.</p></note> Fairfax wrote him a

<p>The civic authorities were not slow to take

responsible for the protection of parliament and the
peace of the city, surely, they reasoned, the appointment
of their own Committee of Militia should be left

<p>Whilst Fairfax was engaged in putting down the

inactive. On the 30th May a petition was presented
to the Common Council, purporting to emanate from
"divers well affected citizens and other inhabitants"
of the city, desiring the court to approach parliament
with the view (<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">inter alia</foreign>) of bringing about a personal
treaty with the king and appeasing the Kentish
insurgents "by way of accommodation and not by
any engagement in blood."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 278b, 279.</p></note> Contrary to its usual
practice the court consented to forward the petition
to both Houses, which it did on the 1st June, with
the result that a deputation from parliament waited
on the court that same afternoon with a verbal reply.

<p>An appeal was made the same day (1 June) by a

Common Hall to be summoned. The appeal was
made to the Common Council. The court took time
to consider the matter. After consulting the law-officers
it was eventually agreed not to accede to the
request, on the plea that, although it was in the power
of the court to assemble the livery for the election
of public officers and other purposes as might be
necessary for the public good of the city, it was neither
fit nor convenient to summon them at the present
juncture on account of the present distraction and

<p>Two days later (3 June), when a deputation from

way to Blackheath under the leadership of the Earl
of Norwich, otherwise known as "Lord Goring,"
and asked that the Militia Committee might speedily
raise what force it could for the protection of parliament

<p>Parliament could not well have done otherwise,
unless they wished to lose their main support—the
support of the City; for although the Earl of Norwich
found the city's gates shut against him, as was
to be expected with Warner occupying the mayoralty
chair and Skippon in command of the trained bands,
there was, as we have seen, a considerable party in
the city who favoured the royalist cause and would

<p>Nor were the municipal authorities themselves

Again and again they called upon parliament to open
a personal treaty with Charles. On the 22nd June
the Common Council directed a petition to both<pb n="283" /><anchor id="Pg283" />

hands that it was the sense of the court.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign>, fo. 281b.</p></note> The petition was

<note place="margin"><p>Petition to parliament by officers of the trained bands, 5 July.</p></note>

<p>A week later (5 July) the Common Council
introduced to the House of Lords another petition, in
which the officers of the trained bands of the city
made a similar request for a personal treaty to be
made with the king in London, and not only repeated
a former request made by the City itself that the
London regiments might be associated with those of
the adjacent counties, but asked that the force thus
formed might be furnished with a contingent of
cavalry. To all these requests the Lords gave a ready
assent.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, x, 362-364; Journal 40, fos. 283b,

<p>The question to be considered was the steps to

the purpose of negotiating. The Common Council,
for their part, undertook in such an event to venture
their lives and fortunes in defending his majesty

appointed a committee to confer with the parliamentary

committee had propounded seven questions
bearing upon the terms of the City's engagement to
protect the king against violence pending negotiations,
and its intentions as to the king's person in the event
of such negotiations falling through. To these the
city committee had made replies (now submitted to
the council for approval), and had added certain
propositions to the parliamentary committee to enable
the City the better to carry out its engagement. The
first two of these related to the amalgamation and
increase of the militia; the third asked that, pending
negotiations, no force should be allowed to come
within thirty miles of London, and that riot and<pb n="285" /><anchor id="Pg285" />
tumult raised in the city during that period after
proclamation made should be met with a death
penalty; and the last that if parliament so willed no
one who had ever taken up arms against it should be
allowed within thirty miles of London without leave.
Both the answers and proposals of the city committee
were alike approved by the council, and a house-to-house
visitation was organised for the purpose of
getting names subscribed to the city's engagement.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Speaker insulted by a member of the city militia, 8 July 1648.</p></note>

<p>The demand for a death penalty on rioters in the
city was not unwarranted. There were not wanting
signs of disaffection even in the ranks of the city's
militia. So recently as Saturday, the 8th July, the
Speaker himself, whilst being escorted to his coach by
a company of soldiers, had been insulted by one in
the ranks, who cried out to the surrounding mob "that
now he was out of their charge they [the mob] should
tear him in pieces."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 286b.</p></note> A few days later (12 July)

<p>It was known that about this time secret enlistments

horses were being despatched out of the city by twos

reported that an attempt was about to be made to
seize the Tower.<note place="foot"><p>Information given to the Common Council by Chetwyn, 12 July.—Journal

nevertheless, remained faithful to parliament, and the
Speaker took the opportunity of a petition addressed
to both Houses (12 July) from "divers well-affected
magistrates, citizens, ministers and other inhabitants"
of the city and parts adjacent, praying them to enter
into no treaty without proper assurances for the
maintenance of the covenant,<note place="foot"><p>The petition, not having emanated from the Corporation, is not
entered on the City's Records, but is printed in Journal House of
Lords, v, 380.</p></note> to compliment the
aldermen and great magistrates of the city on their
courage and fidelity. It was a petition—the Speaker
said, addressing the deputation—for peace, and such
peace as the House and all honest men desired. It
had come at a most seasonable time, when parliament
was the object of much abuse and men dared not own
their true opinions. The petition was the more
valuable from the quality of the petitioners—"divers
aldermen and great magistrates of the city of
London, many reverend ministers, who have always
held close to the cause, and others, the gentlemen of
birth and quality that have less valued their blood
than the hazard and loss of so noble an undertaking."
On behalf of the Commons he returned them real
and hearty thanks, assuring them that the House
approved of the petition and the matter thereof, and
that in prosecuting the peace it would take care to
preserve the religion, laws and liberties of all those
who have been constant to these ends.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, v, 634.</p></note></p>

repeated the old request for an amalgamation of the<pb n="287" /><anchor id="Pg287" />

To the first no answer was vouchsafed. To the
second the Commons replied that the matter had
already been referred to a committee; whilst the
Lords directed an ordinance to be drawn up pursuant
to the wishes of the petitioners. The petition relative
to the militia was met by a counter-petition from
"divers well-affected citizens of London and inhabitants
in and about the same," the authors of which
the Common Council wished to discover.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 287b, 288; Journal House of Commons, v, 639;

<p>In the meantime enlistments of horse and foot had

granted to Skippon, that the municipal authorities
began to get nervous. Servants and apprentices were
reported to have enlisted one another at all hours of the
night, and to have issued spurious commissions. Against
the continuation of such proceedings, which threatened
the city with danger, the authorities petitioned both
Houses (22 July). The Lords consented to revoke
a commission granted to Skippon to raise a troop of
cavalry for the protection of parliament, independently
of the Committee of Militia; the Commons, on the
other hand, determined to let the order stand.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 288b, 289, 289b; Journal House of Lords, x, 389,

civic authorities thereupon yielded to the entreaties of
the inhabitants of the city, and resolved (27 July) to

<p>When Monday came a deputation from the

that were to be taken to prevent irregular enlistments.
Several letters were read for the purpose of demonstrating
the dangers with which the country was still
threatened, among them being one from a royalist
agent in London, in which the writer informed his
correspondent of the progress of the royalist cause in
the city. "We are in this city," he declared,
"generally right; only Skippon makes some disturbance
by listing horse and foot, which, though
inconsiderable to what we have listed for us, yet we
hope not only to null his listing, but out him from
his being general of this city. The Lords have
already done something, but wait for some further

diametrically opposite effect upon the members of the
council than was anticipated, for they still insisted
upon the withdrawal of Skippon's authority under
which the irregular enlistments were carried on. The
Commons, however, refused to be moved from their

<p>Early in November parliament was again pressed
for money and was forced to apply to the City for a
further loan of £4,000 to enable it to proceed with
the "Treaty." It at the same time complained of
the inadequate guard provided by the City for the
protection of the Houses. The guard, it was said,
consisted of hired men, and not citizens, who often
quitted their posts when on duty. The subject led to
an acrimonious debate in the Common Council. As
soon as Alderman Gibbs, who was a member of the
Militia Committee, began to suggest a remedy for the
evil, he was interrupted by Philip Chetwyn, whose
plain speaking had once before created trouble, and
who now boldly charged the alderman and others
with telling "many long stories to put the city in fear
without cause." He declared that at a former council
the alderman had acted in a similar way, "pretending
that the city was in great danger of having their
throats cut whereas there was no such cause." This
speech brought other members of the council on their
legs in defence of the alderman, who declared that
this was not the first time that Chetwyn had done
him wrong, and asked the court to right him. What
he had said at a former council about the danger the
city was in was nothing more than what the Militia
Committee had authorised him to say, and this
statement was corroborated by other members of the
committee then present. Certain questions were
thereupon put to the vote, when it was decided (1)
that Chetwyn had done the alderman a wrong by his
speech, (2) that what the alderman had spoken at a

<note place="margin"><p>The City's reply to the demands of Fairfax, 6 Dec.</p></note>

<p>The Common Council immediately nominated a

the City furnishing the beds as desired. The committee
was further instructed to inform his lordship that if he
would obtain a warrant from the Committee of the<pb n="295" /><anchor id="Pg295" />
Army to the Treasurers at War for the payment of
£10,000, the City would be prepared to pay over the
whole sum of £40,000 (which ought to have been
already paid over) by the next day (7 Dec). There
was one other matter. A rumour had reached the
city that it was intended to arrest Major-General
Browne, who at the time was serving as one of the
sheriffs of London, and the committee were directed
to point out to his excellency the "inconveniences"
likely to arise from such a proceeding.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 307.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Arrest of Major-General Browne, one of the sheriffs, 12 Dec, 1648.</p></note>

<p>Fairfax paid little regard to what might or might
not be convenient for the City, and on the 12th Browne
was arrested, together with Waller, Massey and others,
on the charge of having joined in an invitation to the
Scots to invade England, although it was difficult to
find evidence against them. The Court of Aldermen
immediately interested themselves in endeavouring to
obtain Browne's release, guaranteeing to Fairfax, if he
would set the sheriff free, to produce him whenever
required, and vouching for his "civil and quiet
deportment" in the city.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 59, fo. 325.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Fairfax seizes the Treasure in the City." /><note place="margin"><p>Fairfax seizes the treasury at Weavers' Hall, 8 Dec, 1648.</p></note>

<p>Finding that the money (£40,000) which he had
ordered the City to furnish was not forthcoming on the
day appointed, Fairfax notified the Common Council
by letter (8 Dec.) that he had given orders for seizing
the treasury at Goldsmiths' Hall and Weavers'
Hall. The sum of £27,400 was accordingly seized
at the latter Hall; and this sum Fairfax intended to
keep until the £40,000 should be paid. When that
was done he would withdraw his troops, and not
before. On learning this the Common Council sent a<pb n="296" /><anchor id="Pg296" />
deputation to inform his excellency that, if certain
concessions were made, the City itself would be
responsible for repayment of the money seized, and
that arrears should be got in as speedily as possible.
At the same time Fairfax was asked to withdraw his
troops from the city.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 308.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Soldiers to be withdrawn from the city on payment of arrears within 14 days, 9 Dec., 1648.</p></note>

<p>To these proposals Fairfax replied by letter the

charged on the City for the army up to the 25th March
next ensuing, and still in arrear, to be brought in within
fourteen days, he would repay the money taken from
Weavers' Hall and would withdraw his troops. Their
presence in the city he affected to conceive would
facilitate the collection of the money. On the receipt
of this letter the civic authorities renewed their
exertions to hasten the getting in of assessments.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 59, fo. 323.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The question of discontinuing the city guard of the trained bands referred, 13 Dec.</p></note>

<p>It was thought that a saving might be effected
by the discontinuance of the trained bands in their
duty of guarding the city. They were known to be
very remiss in their duties, piling their arms and
leaving them in charge of some few of their number
whilst the others went away and amused themselves.
They had thus become a laughing-stock to the better
disciplined soldiers of the army, and brought discredit
on the city. The question was eventually left to the
discretion of the Militia Committee to continue the
guards or not as it might think fit.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 308b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Pay demanded for soldiers quartered in the city, 6 Jan., 1649.</p></note>

<p>In spite, however, of every effort the money

maintenance of his troops quartered in the city<pb n="297" /><anchor id="Pg297" />
became an intolerable burden. On Saturday, the 6th
January, 1649, a fortnight's pay, or, £19,000, was due
to the soldiers, and unless the money was found
within four days Fairfax threatened to quarter his
whole army upon the city. A house-to-house visitation
for getting in arrears was organised. A short
extension of time for payment to the army was
asked for and obtained. Ministers were charged to
exhort their parishioners on the intervening Sunday
to pay up their arrears. The money was eventually
advanced by the Treasurers at War on the personal
security of the aldermen and wealthier inhabitants of
each ward.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fos. 309-311.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Ordinances of parliament touching elections to the Common Council, 18 and 20 Dec.</p></note>

<p>The feeling of detestation for the army and of
inclination towards the king had in the meanwhile
been growing stronger in the city day by day. A
royalist lord mayor, in the person of Abraham Reynardson,
had recently been elected, and it was feared
by parliament—or the Rump, as it came to be called—that
the same royalist proclivities would show
themselves in the elections to the Common Council
which were to take place on St. Thomas's day (21
Dec.). An ordinance was accordingly passed on the
18th against the election of "malignants" to the city
council. This ordinance was amended two days
later (20 Dec.) in such a way as to exclude every
citizen who had subscribed to an engagement for a
personal treaty with the king.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, vi, 99, 101; Journal House of Lords,

election to be at once proceeded with. The election
accordingly took place, but when the members came
to take their seats the mayor forbade them unless
they were prepared to take the oath of allegiance,
which had not yet been abolished. This action on
the part of Reynardson being reported to the House,
it directed him (5 Jan., 1649) to forthwith summon
the Common Council together, but to suspend the
taking of oaths until further order.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, vi, 103-104, 105, 111; Rushworth,

<p>On the 13th January, by which day a High
Court of Justice had been especially established for
the king's trial and all royalists had been banished
the city by order of Fairfax,<note place="foot"><p>Dated "Queenstreet," 9 Jan.—Rushworth, vii, 1387, 1388.</p></note> the new Common
Council began to assert itself. The court had been
summoned to meet at eight o'clock in the morning
(not an unusually early hour in those days), but the
mayor did not put in an appearance until eleven, and
then was only accompanied by two aldermen, the
number necessary to form a court. It was soon seen
that there was something wrong. The mayor refused
to acknowledge the authority of the council or to
allow the minutes of the last court to be read in<pb n="299" /><anchor id="Pg299" />
accordance with custom. The council took but little
notice of this and passed on to the next business.
This was a petition to the House of Commons, drawn
up and approved by a committee,<note place="foot"><p>The court had been asked on the 9th Jan. to present a petition to
the House "subscribed by many hands," the purport of which is not
set out in the City's Journal, but was considered to be of such "high
concernment" that the petition was referred to a committee (Journal
40, fo. 310). There is little doubt but that this petition was embodied
in that presented to the House on the 15th.</p></note> asking the House
to execute justice impartially and vigorously "upon
all the grand and capital authors, contrivers of and
actors in the late wars against parliament and
kingdom, from the highest to the lowest," and to
take steps, as the supreme power of the nation, for
the preservation of peace and the recovery of trade
and credit.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 313b.</p></note> Such a petition was so diametrically
opposed to the sentiments of the royalist lord mayor
and his brother aldermen that they got up and left the
court rather than allow the petition to be sanctioned by
their presence. Strictly speaking there was no longer
any court. Nevertheless an attempt was made to
get the Common Sergeant and then the Town Clerk<note place="foot"><p>Robert Michell, the Town Clerk, was soon afterwards (3 July)
dismissed from office; and the same fate threatened Henry Proby, the
Common Sergeant, but the Common Council relented and Proby was

to put the question, but they refused to do so in the
absence of the mayor and aldermen, and they too got
up and left the council chamber. Thus left to themselves
the members of the court voted Colonel Owen
Rowe into the chair. The petition was then three
times read, and after due deliberation unanimously
agreed to, twenty members of the council being
nominated to carry it up to the House, together with<pb n="300" /><anchor id="Pg300" />

<p>In submitting the petition to the Commons on the
15th January, Colonel Robert Tichborne, a member
of the council, explained the reason why the petition
varied in title from other petitions from the city,
purporting, as it did, to come from the commons of
the city alone, and not from the mayor, aldermen and
commons, and with the petition presented a narrative
of the proceedings that had taken place in the council
two days before.<note place="foot"><p>"A narrative of the proceedings of the court of Common Councell

Appendix.</p></note> The House readily accepted the
explanation (as was only to be expected), and declared
that the petition and narrative might and should of
right be entered on the records of the Common
Council. "As to the Common Council of the city of
London, and so owned by this House"—the Speaker
went on to say—"they take notice of the extraordinary
affections long since and often expressed
by many particular persons, if not by every member
of your present body, especially of that true and
publick principle which carried you on to the framing
of this petition, and to your going through with it,
notwithstanding the opposition and withdrawing of
your mayor and aldermen." The Speaker assured
the deputation that the House fully approved of the
members continuing to sit as a Common Council in
the absence or dissent of the mayor or aldermen, or
both together, and concluded by saying that both the<pb n="301" /><anchor id="Pg301" />

<note place="margin"><p>£4,000 still due to the army, 23 Jan.</p></note>

<p>On the 23rd January two officers from the army
waited upon the Court of Aldermen and informed the
members that the sum of £4,000 out of the £19,000
formerly demanded for the army was still in arrear.
The money was in the hands of the Treasurers at War,
but they refused to pay it over until they had received
their security from the wards according to agreement.
Fairfax pressed for an immediate payment, otherwise
he would be under the necessity of quartering troops
of horse and foot upon those wards which had failed
to give the promised security for arrears of assessments.
Rather than this should happen the aldermen
themselves engaged to be security to the treasurers
for payment of the money.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 59, fo. 333.</p></note></p>

<p>In the meanwhile the special tribunal established

its head sat John Bradshaw, a sergeant-at-law and
sometime a judge of the sheriffs' court of the Wood
Street compter in the city.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 131b.</p></note> Five aldermen were

Thomas Andrews, Thomas Atkins, Rowland Wilson
and John Fowke;<note place="foot"><p>Howell's State Trials, iv, 1051, 1052.</p></note> but only the first two named took
any active part in the trial, and Wilson absolutely
declined to serve. Not one of them affixed his signature
to the king's death-warrant. Among the rest
of the commissioners were, however, two citizens of<pb n="302" /><anchor id="Pg302" />
repute, viz., Robert Tichborne, afterwards an alderman,<note place="foot"><p>Of Farringdon Within.—Repertory 59, fo. 456b.</p></note>
and Owen Rowe, both of whom took an active
part in the trial and both signed the warrant for the
king's execution. When put upon his trial in October,
1660, for the part he now took, Tichborne pleaded that
what he had done was through ignorance, and that had
he known more he would sooner have entered a "red
hot oven" than the room in which the warrant was
signed.<note place="foot"><p>Noble's "Lives of the English Regicides," ii, 274, 275.</p></note> His penitence saved his life, and he, like
Pennington, spent the remainder of his days in confinement.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the trial were unreasonably
short and sharp. On Friday, the 19th January,
Charles was brought from Windsor to London. On
the following day he made his first appearance before
his judges. On that day week—Saturday, the 27th—sentence
was pronounced, and three days later
(30 Jan.) it was carried out before the king's own
banquetting-house at Whitehall.</p>

<p>The revolution which was taking place in the
government of the kingdom found its counterpart in
the municipal government of the City, where the
mayor, aldermen and commons bore close analogy
to the king, lords and commons of the realm. The
City was but the kingdom in miniature, the kingdom
was but the City writ large. No sooner was the
house of lords abolished, and with it the right of
the lords to veto the Acts of the commons, than
the Court of Aldermen was deprived of a similar
right over the proceedings of the Common Council.</p>

great opposition, and a debate arose on the question
whether the mayor's motion should take precedence
of the reading of the minutes of the last court or not,
and lasted until nine o'clock at night. At length the
mayor's motion was negatived and the minutes of the
last court were read. It then became known that the
reason for the court being summoned was to hear a
committee's report read. But the mayor at this point
declared himself tired with sitting so long and rose to
go, promising to call a court the next morning or
any time most convenient. Upon certain members
insisting upon the report being read then and there,
his lordship and all the aldermen except one left the

<p>A series of royalist successes in Ireland now
engaged the attention of Cromwell, recently appointed
(15 March) lord-lieutenant of that country, but
nothing could be done without money. More than
a year ago (16 Feb., 1648) an ordinance had been
passed for raising money for Ireland, but in the city
it had been almost treated as a dead letter—"in
divers wards no assessment at all, and in most very
little paid in." The civic authorities had recently
(22 March, 1649) been reminded of their remissness<pb n="310" /><anchor id="Pg310" />
in this respect by a letter from the Council of State,
who threatened to enforce their ordinance if the City
could not be brought to execute it from a sense of
duty.<note place="foot"><p>Cal. State Papers Dom. (1649-1650), p. 50.</p></note></p>

<p>Three weeks later (12 April) a deputation from

before the Common Council and desired a loan of
£120,000 upon the security of the Act for assessment
of £90,000 per month and the Act for sale of fee-farm
rents. The security was not liked, nevertheless the
council nominated a committee to confer with parliament
as to the best means of raising the money.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 40, fo. 317; Journal House of Commons, vi, 185, 186, 187.</p></note></p>

<p>Want of money was not the only difficulty that
Cromwell had to contend with. The levelling spirit
which two years before had displayed itself in the ranks
of the army, and had ever since been fostered by
speeches and writings of the wrong-headed and
impracticable John Lilburne, again asserted itself.
The troops refused to serve in Ireland. A mutiny
broke out at "The Bull," in Bishopsgate Street, the
soldiers refusing to obey their colonel's orders and
seizing the regimental colours. An example had to
be made, so one of the ringleaders was shot in St.
Paul's Churchyard. Five others condemned to death
were pardoned. The funeral of the unfortunate man
who was executed was made the occasion of a public
demonstration against parliament and the army,<note place="foot"><p>Whitelock, pp. 398, 399.</p></note> and
for some time afterwards the Levellers continued to
give trouble in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>On the 25th August Glyn, the city's Recorder,
yielded to pressure and resigned his office. An
attempt had been made in January, 1648, to get him
to resign in favour of William Steele, but he managed
to keep his place notwithstanding his being a prisoner
and threatened with impeachment at the time. On
the 9th August, 1649, the Court of Aldermen desired
him to surrender his place on the ground that both
law and the custom of the city demanded that the
Recorder of the city should be an apprentice of the
law and not a sergeant-at-law.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 59, fo. 472. Glyn had assumed the coif in October,
1648, and in so doing had followed the example of Sir Henry Montague
and others of his predecessors. The City had tried to get rid of
Montague (in 1610) on the same grounds, but failed owing to the
intervention of the king, who emphatically declared that in calling
Montague to be a sergeant-at-law he intended a further mark of favour
to him and to the City, and did not intend that he should lose his place.—Remembrancia
(Index), p. 288.</p></note> The plea was a
shallow one, and Glyn declined to accede to their
request, as being prejudicial to himself and as casting<pb n="316" /><anchor id="Pg316" />
a slur upon his profession. This answer he made on
the 18th August. Nevertheless by that day week he
had thought better of it, and came into court and
there "freely tendred" his resignation, which was
accepted as "his own free voluntary act." The court
voted him the sum of £300 in recognition of his past
services and appointed William Steele in his place.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 59, fo. 474. As early as the 3rd July the Common
Council (presumably by virtue of the resolution of parliament of 28 Feb.,

which it is historically famous. On the 24th October<pb n="317" /><anchor id="Pg317" />
(1649) John Lilburne was brought to trial for spreading
seditious pamphlets. Parliament had shown every
disposition to conciliate this impracticable reformer,
but all its efforts had been futile. "Tell your masters
from me," said he to a friend who visited him in the
Tower, "that if it were possible for me now to choose,
I had rather choose to live seven years under old
King Charles's government (notwithstanding their
beheading him as a tyrant for it) when it was at the
worst before this parliament, than live one year
under their present government that now rule; nay,
let me tell you, if they go on with that tyranny they

Oyer and Terminer, presided over by Andrews, the outgoing
Lord Mayor, and including the Recorder, the
Common Sergeant and nine aldermen, was opened at
the Guildhall on Wednesday, the 24th October. The
trial lasted three days. Lilburne made a spirited
defence, winding up with a solemn peroration in which
he invoked God Almighty to guide and direct the
jury "to do that which is just, and for His glory."
His words sent a thrill of enthusiasm through the
crowded hall, the audience with "an extraordinary
great hum" giving vent to cries of "Amen! Amen!"
in such a manner that Skippon, who was in attendance,
deemed it advisable to send for more troops in
case of disturbance. When in the end a verdict of
acquittal was brought in, a wild scene followed.
"The whole multitude in the hall, for joy of the
prisoner's acquittal, gave such a loud and unanimous
shout as is believed was never heard in Guildhall,
which lasted for about half an hour without intermission."
The judges turned pale from fear, but the
prisoner at the bar, so far from displaying any excess
of joy, remained unmoved and silent, and "rather
more sad in his countenance than he was before."<note place="foot"><p>"The Triall of Lieut.-Col. John Lilburne at the Guildhall, 24,

<p>The question how to deal with the poor of the

<index index="toc" level1="The Borough of Southwark desires Incorporation." /><note place="margin"><p>Inhabitants of borough of Southwark desire incorporation. 4 Dec., 1649.</p></note>

<p>There was another matter of municipal interest
which claimed the attention of the civic authorities
about this time. Ever since 1550, when, as we have
seen, the borough of Southwark first became completely
subject to the jurisdiction of the city, the inhabitants
of the borough had suffered from the anomalous position
of being ruled by an alderman not of their choosing,
and by a Common Council to which they sent no
representatives. Nevertheless, it was not until the
close of 1649 that they began to raise any serious
objection to the existing state of things.  On the 4th<pb n="325" /><anchor id="Pg325" />
December of that year they petitioned parliament
that they might be incorporated or enfranchised either
with or without the City, on the ground that, as matters
stood, their poor were neglected and they suffered
from "diversity of jurisdictions," under which they
were subjected to "double service and charges," such
as no other body suffered throughout the kingdom.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 17b; Journal House of Commons, vi, 329.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City's answer, 21 May, 1650.</p></note>

<p>Early in the following year (28 Jan., 1650) the
City presented a counter petition in defence of its
rights and privileges in Southwark, and the whole
matter was referred by parliament to the Committee
for Corporations.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fos. 17b, 19b; Journal House of Commons, vi, 351.</p></note> The inhabitants of Southwark
having submitted their case to the committee, the
City were called upon to make reply.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fos. 22, 24.</p></note> They, in
effect, denied that the inconveniences mentioned by
the petitioners were caused by their being under the
City's government. As to the alleged grievance of
being subject to concurrent jurisdictions, that was
nothing uncommon. Not that the City itself countenanced
variety of jurisdiction over the borough.
Far from it. In fact, the civic authorities had recently
themselves applied to parliament for the removal of
the "Court Marshall" (or Marshalsea) and the abolition
of the "Marshall of the Upper Bench" from the
borough. The answer concluded by assuring the
Committee for Corporations that if any inconveniences
arose in the borough from any defect in the City's
government the City would be pleased to receive the
assistance of the inhabitants in asking the supreme
authority of parliament to amend it.  No defect,<pb n="326" /><anchor id="Pg326" />
however, could justify the separation of the borough
from the City. There was another objection. The
incorporation of Southwark would not only be an
invasion of the City's rights, but would work injury to
the several companies and fraternities of the city which
for trade purposes had become incorporated. These
exercised their power of government over, and received
support from, their members who were not exclusively
inhabitants of the city, but dwellers in the suburbs
two or three miles away. A conference was proposed
between the parties,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 27b.</p></note> but nothing appears to have
come of it, and the matter was allowed to rest for
another hundred years and more.</p>

<p>Cromwell had not been long in Ireland before the
country began to assume at least a semblance of prosperity.
The good achieved by the city of London and
the companies in Ulster in the earlier years of the
plantation had well nigh disappeared during the
troublous times of the civil war. Londonderry itself
had suffered two sieges at the hands of the royalists,
but the garrison on both occasions had displayed the
same indomitable courage as that which in later years
made them famous in the pages of history, and with
like success. Cruel as was Cromwell's policy in
Ireland it accomplished its object. By February,
1650, Bradshaw was able to write to the mayor of
London<note place="foot"><p>Copy of letter preserved among the archives of the Grocers'
Company. <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Cf.</foreign> Council of State, day's proceedings, 10 Feb.—Cal.

Council of State to "plant" the seaports in Ulster,
which had by God's blessing been reduced to obedience.
He understood that the City had or "pretended<pb n="327" /><anchor id="Pg327" />
to have" some interest in the towns of Londonderry
and Coleraine, with other lands and fishings in Ulster,
and he desired to know if the City intended to vindicate
its right or claim. If so, the lord mayor was advised
to depute someone to attend the committee appointed
by the Council of State for Irish affairs and explain
to him the nature of the City's rights. This letter
having been read to the Court of Aldermen on the
19th February, counsel was instructed to investigate
the City's interest in Ireland.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 60, fo. 70b.</p></note> A committee of
aldermen was subsequently appointed to confer with
representatives of the several livery companies on the
matter. Although Bradshaw's letter had desired a
speedy reply, it was not until the 9th May that a
report was submitted to the Court of Aldermen.
This report, which had received the assent of the
companies, recommended that counsel should forthwith
be instructed to assert the rights of the City
and the companies to the towns and lands originally
conveyed by letters patents of the 30th March, 1613,
to the Irish Society.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 131b-133.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Cromwell welcomed on return from Ireland, 31 May, 1650.</p></note>

<p>When Cromwell returned to England at the end
of May (1650), having all but stamped out the rebellion
in Ireland, he was met at Hounslow Heath by a huge
concourse of people, including many members of
parliament and the chief officers of the army. At
Hyde Park, where it is said that the lord mayor and
the militia awaited him, although no directions to that
effect appear in the City's Records, he was received
with a volley of artillery.<note place="foot"><p>Whitelock, p. 457; Guizot, <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">op. cit.</foreign> i, 120.</p></note> He had returned at the
express desire of parliament, who required his services<pb n="328" /><anchor id="Pg328" />
in Scotland. No time was lost. On Wednesday, the
26th June, an Act was passed constituting him
"commander-in-chief of all the forces raised or to be
raised by the authority of parliament within the
Commonwealth of England,"<note place="foot"><p>Whitelock, p. 462.</p></note> in place of Fairfax,
and on the following Saturday he set out for the North.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Cromwell in Scotland.</p></note>

<p>Two days before parliament thus transferred the
command of the army from Fairfax to Cromwell,
Charles II had landed in Scotland and Fairfax had
displayed some scruples in opposing the Scots, who,
as he declared, had a right to choose their own form
of government. Not so Cromwell. He saw the
danger that was likely to arise from such a concession,
and he resolved forthwith to make an attempt on
Edinburgh. He was, however, out-manœuvred by
Leslie and forced to fall back upon Dunbar. There he
was fortunate enough to utterly rout the Scottish
forces (3 Sept.) by one of those dashing cavalry
charges for which his "Ironsides" were famous.</p>

<p>This victory, which contributed more perhaps than
anything else to establish the Commonwealth, was
celebrated in the city by a public thanksgiving. A
"convenient dinner" was ordered by the Common
Council (12 Sept.) to be provided for that day, to which
Major-General Harrison, Major-General Skippon, the
lieutenant of the Tower, and others were to be
invited. The City's latest acquisition, the New Park
at Richmond, was laid under contribution for venison.
The dinner was not on this occasion paid for out of
the City's cash, owing probably to the low condition
of the Chamber, but was defrayed by the payment of<pb n="329" /><anchor id="Pg329" />
ten shillings by each alderman and five shillings by
each commoner.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 34.</p></note> The names of those who refused

remained statues of James and of Charles. These
the Court of Aldermen had been ordered to remove
(31 July, 1650). They were further ordered to see that
the head of Charles's statue at the Royal Exchange
was struck off, the sceptre in the effigy's hand broken,
and an inscription set up hard by proclaiming the

<p>To such an extent were they ground down by
taxation (the city alone being assessed at a fifteenth

to be laid before parliament on the subject a fortnight
later (24 March).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 46b.</p></note> Whilst acknowledging the care

the nation at the least possible charge, and declaring
their willingness to bear their share in defraying
expenses with the rest of the nation, the petitioners
prayed for a more equitable amount of taxation
than that which they had hitherto been called upon
to bear. The reasons they gave were (1) the losses
which merchants had sustained within the last few
years by the interruption of foreign trade, vessels
belonging to citizens of London having been constantly
seized by Prince Rupert and others who roamed the
seas for piratical purposes, and (2) the withdrawal
of the wealthier class of citizens to the suburbs of
London, where houses were increasing, and where
taxation was less than in the city.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Parliament authorises the raising of 4,000 horse, 8 April, 1651.</p></note>

<p>Before the House found time to take this petition
into consideration<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, vi, 554, 556.</p></note> it had granted (8 April) authority
to the Council of State to raise out of the militias
of the several counties a force of horse and dragoons
not exceeding the number of 3,000 horse and 1,000
dragoons. The civic authorities lost no time in
representing to parliament that the City had always
been exempt from the charge of providing horse.
They were ready, however, to bear their proportion
of the necessary charge with the rest of the kingdom.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 47b.</p></note>
Later on they became more complaisant, and expressed
their readiness to furnish the number of horse
demanded "in respect of the pressing occasions and
necessities now lying on the Commonwealth," notwithstanding
the proportion laid on the City was
greater than that imposed on any other part of the
nation. It was stipulated that the City's assent was<pb n="333" /><anchor id="Pg333" />
not to be drawn into a precedent for the future.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 48.</p></note> The
Council of State, on the other hand, would not for
a moment allow that the City had been called upon
to contribute more than its just proportion. London
was a large place, they said, where many opportunities
arose for outbreaks, and where there was
not always a force at hand to put them down. They
doubted not there were many well-affected persons
within London, Westminster, the Hamlets and Southwark,
able and willing to lend their horses, with well-affected
riders, for the prevention of mischief, and
they recommended that such should be encouraged.<note place="foot"><p>Letter of Council of State, 6 May.—Cal. State Papers Dom.

made a proposition distasteful to the mayor and

happened to be present to break up the court by
taking their departure. Mention has already been

on matters which must have deeply affected the

we learn that three regiments of volunteers were
formed in London and its suburbs for the special
purpose of serving as a guard to parliament. The
powers of the Committee for the Militia of the
City were enlarged, and the number of members
increased by fifteen individuals, among whom was
Lieutenant-Colonel John Fenton, who had been
removed from the Common Council by order of
parliament. The militia throughout the country was
called out, and a month's pay ordered to be advanced

declarations of the Scottish king in his hands, or discovered
inciting to a breach of the peace, was declared
to be a traitor, and as such would be executed.
Within the late lines of communication strict supervision
was to be kept over all houses. Lodgers'
names were to be taken and registered; servants and
children were to be allowed out of doors only at
certain hours. The execution of these and similar
orders was entrusted to the lord mayor and the rest
of the Committee for the Militia of the City in conjunction
with the Commissioners for the Militia of
Westminster, the Hamlets and Southwark, who were
required to meet and sit daily for the purpose. A

<p>The attempt made to cripple the carrying trade

(Oct., 1651) found little favour with the merchants
of the city. What they of all things desired to see
was free trade in the port of London; and to this end

and appointed (9 Dec.) a committee to maintain it

<p>This Act failed in its purpose, and only led to
retaliation and war. In the spring of the following
year (1652) the fleet was got ready to put to sea. On
the 26th March the Council of State wrote to the
mayor and aldermen and Militia Committee of the
city<note place="foot"><p>Cal. State Papers Dom. (1651-1652), p. 196.</p></note> asking that certain brass guns laid up at Gresham
College and other places in the city should be forthwith
delivered to the ordnance officer, as the guns
formerly used in the fleet during the late wars had
been dispersed among various garrisons. By way of
postscript—as if an afterthought—the council added:
"As there is a pretension of right made to such guns
on behalf of the city we shall be ready to receive
and consider any claim which they shall make to
them; and if it appear that they belong to the city
we will take care, after the service is past to which<pb n="344" /><anchor id="Pg344" />
they are designed, that they are either restored or
satisfaction made according to their value." In May
it was found that the store of gunpowder in the Tower
was likely to run short owing to a breach of contract,
and again application for assistance was made to the
City, who were asked to lend such gunpowder as lay
in the Companies' halls.<note place="foot"><p>Proceedings of Council of State, 24 and 29 May, 1652.—Cal.

By that time a victory had been gained over the
Dutch admirals Tromp and De Ruyter off Portland
(18 Feb., 1653) by Blake and Monk, the latter
having for a time exchanged land service for the
sea. This success was the more welcome inasmuch
as Blake had previously suffered a signal defeat
(28 Nov., 1652) at the hands of the Dutch admirals
and had himself been wounded. Moreover Tromp
had been so elated at his victory that in bravado he
had fixed a broom to his masthead, in token of his
resolution to sweep the sea of English vessels.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Subscriptions opened in the city for wounded soldiers and sailors, 4 March, 1653.</p></note>

The commissioners assumed a very haughty tone.
They were, they said, entrusted with full powers to
deal with such matters by parliament, but expressed
their intention to "be tender to passe severe sentence
upon any well affected citizen. For that they have
power to doe it or not to doe it." This was not at
all to the mind of the Common Council, who thereupon
resolved (4 March, 1653) to ask parliament to
explain who were promoters and abettors of the
Treasonable Engagement, and whether the citizens
were to be considered as promoters and abettors for
having obeyed the orders of the militia authorised by
parliament in manning forts and appearing in arms,

as well as of themselves.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fos. 81b, 82.</p></note> Before any answer was

to us (see Loftie's "History of London," Appendix B). But
that the city did send six members to this parliament is the more
probable from the fact that in June, 1657, the Common Council prepared
a petition to parliament praying to be allowed to send "their full
number" of six burgesses "already chosen" to parliament.—Journal
41, fo. 156. Moreover, the fact that in March, 1653, the Common
Council ordered a petition to be prepared for parliament "touching the
number of future burgesses for this city in parliament," points to some
probable alteration in the number of city members.—<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign>, 41, fo. 83.</p></note></p>

<p>This parliament, like its predecessor, was of short
duration, lasting little more than five months. One
other parliament and no more was summoned by
Cromwell (17 Sept., 1656). It was before this parliament
that Alderman Sir Christopher Pack (the only
member for the city, so far as we have any authentic
record), brought forward (23 Feb., 1657) his famous
"remonstrance," desiring the Protector to assume the
kingly dignity and to restore the House of Lords.
The question whether the "remonstrance" should be
read was answered in the affirmative by a majority of<pb n="349" /><anchor id="Pg349" />
nearly 100 after some hours' debate.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, vii, 496.</p></note> Before it was

assent of the Commons, and on the 31st March a copy
of it engrossed on vellum was presented to the
Protector at Whitehall in the presence of the whole
House. Its main feature was the creation of a second
House, the members of which were to enjoy their
seats for life and exercise some of the functions of the
former House of Lords. Cromwell was asked to
assume the title of king with the right of naming his
own successor. The kingship after considerable
hesitation he declined (8 May): "I cannot undertake
this government with the title of king. And that
is mine answer to this great and weighty business."<note place="foot"><p>Id., vii, 533.</p></note>
The rest of the terms he accepted, and on the 28th

government of the city was shown to depend upon
"two strong supports," viz., the customs of the city

divers Acts of Parliament; that by virtue of these
charters and customs the mayor was chosen by the
citizens, that he remained in office for no more than
one year, and was presented to the supreme power of
the nation for approbation. The petition went on to
remind the House how on various occasions, and
notably on the 13th January, 1644, and the 6th and
18th May of the same year, parliament had formally
acknowledged the constant affection and assistance it
had received from the city, and concluded by praying
the House to lay no restraint upon the free election
of their mayor by the citizens nor infringe the ancient
customs and charters of the city, a breach of which

Fleetwood that it might be well to omit the usual<pb n="357" /><anchor id="Pg357" />

vindicating the rights of parliament. Whether he
had any ulterior motive in view at the time is not

Lambert's army to secure the support of the City

was some little bloodshed, two men being killed. This
brought the army into greater disrepute than ever,

<p>The spirit that had moved Haslerigg, Morley,
Walton and Lawson at length moved the rank and
file of the army in London. The soldiers placed
themselves at the command of their cashiered officers.
On the 24th December they marched to Lenthall's
house in Chancery Lane, expressed their sorrow for
the past, and promised to stand by parliament for the
future. On the 26th the Rump was for the second
time restored to power.<note place="foot"><p>Whitelock, p. 691; Clarendon, p. 936.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Presentation of petition postponed, 29 Dec., 1659.</p></note>

<p>The citizens had obtained their desire to have
once more a parliament, but the parliament they got
was far from being the free parliament they had been
looking for. They wished to take an early opportunity—lest
their action should be misinterpreted—to
inform the Rump that the measures they had taken
for "settling" the trained bands had been taken before
"their honors came together this last time." They
desired to explain the reasons for undertaking the
work, and to show that in so doing the city had only
acted within its rights. A petition was accordingly
drawn up on the 28th December, setting forth that
disorders in the city had increased "by the exorbitant
actings of many of those men who at first being
appointed by parliament a Committee of Militia
within the city of London for their security and
safety, have since their last interruption acted by a<pb n="363" /><anchor id="Pg363" />
commission under the Great Seal of England against
the same parliament," and that for the prevention
of any disorder that might arise they had fallen back
upon their ancient rights and usages, and had put
themselves in a posture of defence, not for the purpose
of acting against parliament, but for it. Whilst offering
these explanations the City was anxious that parliament
would receive into its House all such members as
were still alive and fill up the places of all who were
dead. On the 29th the Common Council resolved
that this petition should not be laid before the House
until further order.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fos. 216-217.</p></note> The commissioners appointed

<p>Monk's letter to the City, sent in November, had

<p>On the last day of the year a deputation from the
House, including Lenthall, Haslerigg, Morley and
others, waited upon the Court of Aldermen to confer
with them about the safety of the city. The erection
of the city posts and chains, which apparently had
been proceeded with, and the calling out of the
trained bands troubled parliament. By the 2nd
January Haslerigg was able to satisfy parliament on
the first head. It was contrary (he said) to the mind
of the lord mayor, aldermen and Common Council to<pb n="364" /><anchor id="Pg364" />
have any posts or chains set up, and those that were
set up should be taken down.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, vii, 800, 802.</p></note> Two days later (4 Jan.)
the Common Council ordered the settlement of the

a committee to lay before parliament the grounds and
reasons for so doing, the committee being instructed
to again press for a full and free parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 218.</p></note> The
attitude of the City towards the restored Rump was
keenly watched by royalists abroad. "Let me know

wrote secretary Nicholas, "and settling their own

<note place="margin"><p>The citizens decline to pay taxes until parliament be filled up.</p></note>

<p>The City's anxiety for a return of a full and free
parliament in the place of the Rump was occasioned
in some degree by the fact that in the existing House
they had but a single representative, viz., Alderman
Atkin, and without due representation the citizens
refused to be subjected to taxation. "They were
resolved," Pepys notes in his diary (13 Jan.), "to
make no more applications to the parliament, nor to
pay any money, unless the secluded members be
brought in or a free parliament chosen."</p>

<p>In the meantime Lambert, who had set out for

by the middle of January Monk and his army were

<p>In order to avoid as much as possible the appearance
of entering London as a conqueror, Monk brought
with him no more than 5,000 men, a force considerably
less than that which was quartered in London and
Westminster. Having reached St. Albans, he wrote
to the Speaker asking that five of the regiments in
the capital might be removed to a distance before his
arrival lest his troops should become disaffected by
intercourse with those who had been so recently
engaged in rebellion. The House acquiesced and gave
orders to that effect, but the soldiers refused to leave
their quarters, swearing that they would not go
without their money, and threatening if their pay was
not received to "go where they might have it, and<pb n="366" /><anchor id="Pg366" />

assigned to him at Whitehall recently occupied by
Bradshaw.<note place="foot"><p>Bradshaw had died 31 Oct., 1659. The place of under Sheriff

<note place="margin"><p>A City deputation to Monk, 8 Feb.</p></note>

<p>Monk was anxious to feel the pulse of the City
before committing himself to any definite policy. He
had not long to wait before he was assured of its
favour. On the 8th February the Common Council
agreed to send a deputation to the general to
congratulate him upon his coming to London and to
thank him for his courtesy to the City's commissioners
recently despatched to him, as well as to express a
hope that the good understanding which had prevailed
between his excellency and the City might continue.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 219b.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Common Council dissolved by order of the Rump, 9 Feb.</p></note>

<p>The friendly attitude of the City towards Monk,
and its recent hostile attitude towards parliament—some
of the Common Council, we are told, had been
"very high" at the last court, and refused to pay
taxes until the House should be filled up<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 9 Feb.</p></note>—was so
marked that the Rump determined upon dissolving
the Common Council, although it commended the
"discreet carriage" of the lord mayor in conducting
the business of the court.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, vii, 838.</p></note> Not content with this<pb n="367" /><anchor id="Pg367" />
the House went further, and ordered troops to be
quartered in the city "for reducing the city to the
obedience of the parliament." The city's gates and
portcullises, moreover, were to be removed, and
eleven citizens, including an alderman, were ordered
into custody.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, vii, 837.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Takes up his quarters in the City." /><note place="margin"><p>Monk in the city.</p></note>

<p>The unenviable task of seeing these orders
executed was, by a clever stroke of policy, committed
to Monk himself. There was no alternative open to
him but to obey, and to carry out the orders of
parliament with as little friction to the citizens as
was possible. No sooner had he taken up his
residence in the city for this purpose than he was
asked by the mayor to delay removing the city's
gates until the matter should be communicated to the
Court of Aldermen.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Monk confers with the Court of Aldermen, 10 Feb.</p></note>

<p>A special court having been summoned Monk
attended in person (10 Feb.) and informed the
members of the commands that had been laid upon
him by parliament touching the city's gates and
portcullises. Being told that the execution of such
commands would be "of very ill consequence both to
parliament and the city" the general could only
reply that the commands of the House were so
positive that he could only hold his hand on one
condition, and that was that the city should acknowledge
the Rump that so he might have ground for
writing to and mediating with the House. The
court was allowed to consider the matter whilst
Monk withdrew. Upon his return he was informed
that the Court of Aldermen could not speak on<pb n="368" /><anchor id="Pg368" />
behalf of the whole body of citizens, "and that the
Common Council being now disabled to meet, there
was none in capacity to do it." But, said his
excellency, the Court of Aldermen might declare
their own minds? Again Monk withdrew, only to
be told, however, on his return that the court was
of opinion that their doing so "would not at this time
be a service either to the parliament or city."<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 67, fo. 42b.</p></note></p>

<p>The next day (11 Feb.) the Court of Aldermen
again met. Monk, too, was there. He had just
despatched a letter to the Speaker of the House
complaining of the invidious work he and his soldiers
had been set to do—a work which served only to
bring them into discredit with the city—and
peremptorily demanding that every seat in the
House should be filled up by the following Friday
(17 Feb.) as a preliminary to the calling together of
a new parliament. When the aldermen heard of this
letter they were delighted, and ready to accede to
anything Monk might suggest. He proposed quartering
troops in the city "for a few days." The aldermen
raised no objection, but asked his excellency to utilise
as far as possible the inns and public victualling houses,
"so as may be least offence to the citizens."<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 43.</p></note> They
even displayed a readiness to give up their own houses
to the use of the general and his officers, and promised
that his soldiers should lack nothing.<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 11 Feb., 1660.</p></note> On his quitting
the court such a shout was raised of "God bless your

were lighted that evening from Cheapside to Temple
Bar, bells were set ringing, and rumps carried in mock<pb n="369" /><anchor id="Pg369" />
procession and solemnly roasted in token of the
approaching dissolution of parliament. So great was
the hospitality offered to the soldiers that most of
them got gloriously drunk.<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 11 and 13 Feb.</p></note></p>

<p>On Monday (13 Feb.) he held a conference with
the mayor and aldermen at Drapers' Hall, a stone's
throw from where he lived, with reference to the
peace and safety of the city. Alderman Atkin, a
member of parliament, was sent for to be informed of
"sundry matters of great danger to the city," of which
information had reached the ears of the Court of

where they could keep a better watch on his movements.

<p>Monk was in no hurry to quit the city. On Wednesday
(15 Feb.) he sent for Alderman Fowke to say
that he purposed marching out of the city with his
forces on the following afternoon, but that in so doing
he had no intention of receding from his promise to
secure the safety of the city. He would also endeavour
to bring about a right understanding between parliament
and the city. Fowke having reported this to
the Court of Aldermen there was great alarm, and a
deputation was despatched, with Fowke at its head,
to beg the general to let his soldiers remain in the
city "if it may consist with his trust." Word was
brought next day to the court that in the event of his
excellency quitting the city he would leave behind
two regiments for its safety, and that if the court
would give him the names of persons fit to be officers
he would endeavour to get two regiments of their
own appointed by parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 67, fos. 45-46b.</p></note></p>

<p>In the meanwhile parliament had been busy
completing the bill for the qualifications of electors
and candidates for the new parliament, and on the
day fixed (17 Feb.) by Monk writs were ready to<pb n="371" /><anchor id="Pg371" />
be issued. According to the qualifications passed by
the House, no one could be elected a member of the
forthcoming parliament unless pledged to support a
republican form of government. As this meant the
exclusion of the members shut out by Pride's Purge in
1648 it gave rise to much dissatisfaction, and Monk
was appealed to. A deputation of the sitting members
met a deputation of the excluded members at Monk's
new quarters, when it was decided that the Presbyterian
members shut out by Pride's Purge should
again be allowed to take their seats. Four days later
(21 Feb.) they attended parliament at Monk's invitation
and were admitted without opposition.</p>

<p>The day passed off without any disturbance,
although it was feared that the "secluded" members
might attempt to force their way into parliament. It
was also feared that if such an attempt were made it
would be backed up by some inhabitants of the
city. The council had therefore asked Monk to
take precautions for securing the freedom of parliament
as well as maintaining peace within the city.<note place="foot"><p>Council of State to Monk, 20 Feb., 1660.—Cal. State Papers

and published) are preserved in the Guildhall library.</p></note></p>

<p>After expressions of satisfaction at the thought of
an end having been put to the distractions of the kingdom
by General Monk, and at the hopeful prospect
of a return to the old form of government by king,
lords and commons, under which the country had so
long prospered at home and been respected abroad,
this declaration proceeded to disavow the various
Acts of the Common Council as established in 1648,
when, "in the general deluge of disorder introduced
upon these kingdoms" in that year, the government
of the city passed into the hands of "men of loose and
dangerous principles," who proceeded to pass Acts
"tending to the murder of the late king and total
extinguishment of kingly government," and who by
no means were a fair representation of the city. It
set forth various proceedings of the Common Council
in connection with parliament and the city's Engagement
to guarantee the personal safety of the late king<pb n="376" /><anchor id="Pg376" />
from the 22nd June, 1648, down to the 13th January,
1649, when the lord mayor Reynardson was constrained
to leave the council. The terms of this
Engagement the City was prepared to carry out,
"but it pleased Almighty God to permit their good
intentions and endeavours to be frustrated by the
destructive counsels and actings of those who had
designed to build upp their dominion and fortunes
on the ruin of the king and kingdom." The House
of Lords was dissolved, and all the best members
excluded from the House of Commons. By "pretended
ordinances" of parliament, all those worthy
citizens who, according to their allegiance and covenant,
had engaged to procure and secure a personal
treaty with the king, were rendered incapable to be
elected into the Common Council or any other office
of trust in the city.</p>

<p>What could be expected of a body thus emasculated?
They declare themselves unable to find words
to express their abhorrence of the proceedings that
had taken place in the Common Council of the 13th
January, 1649, and "profess their thankful memory
of the noble gallant resolutions of the then lord
mayor, Alderman Reynardson, and his brethren the
aldermen, who so valiantly resisted the turbulent
disorders of that <foreign rend="font-style: italic">mechanicke juncto</foreign> during many
hours' assault and at last prudently retreated and
washed their hands from the guilt of those bloody
resolves." In conclusion they express a hope and
trust that since the recovery of the right of free
election the Common Council had manifested an eagerness
to act cordially and strenuously with parliament
in everything tending towards good government, and<pb n="377" /><anchor id="Pg377" />
that soon, by the aid of the parliament recently convened,
they would be put under the protection of
the first and fundamental government of hereditary
monarchy according to the ancient laws of the nation.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Letter from Charles II to the City." /><note place="margin"><p>Letter from Charles to the City read before the Common Council, 1 May, 1660.</p></note>

<p>The City's declaration and vindication was scarcely
printed and published before a letter from Charles
himself<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 230; Remembrancia ix, 1 (Index, p. 423.)</p></note> was brought to the Common Council by Lord
Mordaunt and Sir John Grenville (1 May), in which
the prince expressed a wish that the City should know
how little he desired revenge and how convinced he
was that the peace, happiness and security of the kingdom
were only to be secured by gaining the hearts
and affections of his subjects. He felt that he could
count upon the City to assist him in re-establishing
those fundamental laws upon which the happiness of
the country so much depended, and he avowed a
"particular affection" for his native city, the charters
of which he was not only ready to renew and confirm,
but to grant such new favours as might advance
its trade, wealth and honour.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Declaration of Breda." /><note place="margin"><p>The Declaration of Breda, 4 April.</p></note>

<p>Enclosed in this letter was a declaration known
as the Declaration of Breda, from the place where
Charles had signed it on the 4th April (o.s.)<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 230b; Remembrancia ix, 2 (Index, p. 423).</p></note> It
offered a general pardon to all except those specially
exempted by parliament and promised liberty of
conscience in matters of religion. Charles further
expressed his willingness to leave questions of title to
estates acquired during the late troublous times to be
decided by parliament. He assured the soldiers of
arrears of pay and promised to continue them in his
service on the same terms as they then enjoyed.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Thanks of the city for the king's letter and declaration, 1 May, 1660.</p></note>

<p>The letter and declaration having been read
(1 May), the Common Council returned thanks to
Charles for his condescension towards the City, and
expressed their willingness to submit to his majesty's
government, in token of which the arms of the
Commonwealth (he was informed) had already been
taken down and orders given for those of his majesty
to be set up. A committee was appointed to draw up
a formal answer in writing for conveyance to Charles
by the same hands that had brought his letter, provided
parliament would allow the City to return an
answer. The late king's statue, which had been
removed from the Guildhall chapel, was to be forthwith
set up again.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 231; Cal. State Papers Dom. (1659-1660), p. 430.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Convention Parliament sends to borrow £100,000 of the city, 2 May.</p></note>

<p>Charles having shrewdly thrown upon parliament
the burden of naming the terms on which his restoration
was to take place, it became necessary that a
parliament should meet forthwith. Another Convention
Parliament had accordingly met on the 25th
April. The declaration of Breda reached it on the
1st May, and on the following day it sent to borrow
£100,000 from the City. The Common Council at
once took steps for raising the money.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 231b.</p></note> One half of
this sum was destined for the king's own use, and
sorely he stood in need of it. Pepys, who had it from
an eye-witness, records "how overjoyed the king was
when Sir J. Grenville brought him some money; so
joyful that he called the Princess Royal and Duke
of York to look upon it as it lay in the portmanteau
before it was taken out."<note place="foot"><p>Diary, 16 May.</p></note></p>

<p>The same day (2 May) that the Common Council
undertook to raise the loan for parliament it voted
on its own account a gift of £10,000 to Charles. It
also voted a sum of £2,000 for expenses in sending a
deputation to the Hague; but it was subsequently
resolved to divide the sum between the Dukes of
York and Gloucester, and that the members of the
deputation should discharge their own expenses. A
further sum of £300 was voted for Lord Mordaunt
and Sir John Grenville, the bearers of the king's
letters, for the purchase of a ring apiece. The sum
of £12,000 was raised among the livery companies
on the understanding that this was an exceptional
occasion and was not to be drawn into precedent.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fos. 231b, 232, 232b, 233b; Pepys, Diary, 4 May.</p></note></p>

<p>Besides returning an answer by the hands of the

sixteen commissioners to wait upon the king at the
Hague with the City's formal answer.<note place="foot"><p>The commissioners appointed (3 May) were the following:—Thomas
Adams, alderman; William Wild, esq., Recorder; John
Robinson and Antony Bateman, aldermen; Theophilus Biddulph,

Chamberlen, Mr. Richard Ford and Colonel Bromefield. Of these
Alderman Robinson, Recorder Wild, Biddulph and Vincent were
members of parliament, the consent of which had to be obtained before
they set sail. Six more commissioners were added the following day
(4 May), viz., Alderman Reynardson, Alderman Langham, Sir Thomas
Foote, Sir James Bunce, Alderman Wale and William Bateman,
esquire. Foote declined the honour.—Journal 41, fos. 231b, 232.</p></note> By the 28th
May the commissioners returned and reported the
success of their expedition to the Common Council.
They had been very graciously received by Charles,
who had conferred knighthood upon those who had
not already received that honour. The court gave
them a hearty vote of thanks for the great pains and
charges they had been put to.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 234; Clarendon (ed. 1839), p. 962.</p></note></p>

<p>In the meantime Charles had been publicly proclaimed
king in the city by the lord mayor (8 May),
who, in honour of the occasion, had been specially
provided with a new crimson velvet gown, whilst his
Swordbearer in attendance was scarcely less gorgeous

City's sword having been offered to the king and
returned, Charles conferred the honour of knighthood
upon Thomas Aleyne, the lord mayor, and partook
of refreshment in the lord mayor's tent, set up for the
purpose. From there to Whitehall the journey was
one long triumphal procession through streets strewn
with flowers and lined with members of the companies
in their handsome liveries. Never was there such a

<p>On the afternoon of Saturday, the 2nd June
(1660), the mayor and aldermen, accompanied by the
Recorder, waited upon the king to congratulate him
on his return and to restore to him Richmond Park,
according to a resolution of the Common Council.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fo. 232b.</p></note>
Speaking on behalf of the City, the Recorder expressly
declared that it was done by way of restitution and
not as a gift. He assured the king that it was well
that the park had been in the City's hands, for they
had preserved the wood, vert and game. Not to be
outdone in courtesy the king replied that "the city
of London were still loading him with their kindness,
and that he looked upon the said park to be
kept for him, and that he accepted it not as restored,
but as freely given unto him by the city, and thanked
them for the same."<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 234b.</p></note></p>

those aldermen who were not barred by the Statute of

Common Council, a duty which he was rendered
incapable of fulfilling owing to his having been
appointed at that time high-sheriff of Shropshire,
seized the opportunity of presenting a petition to the
court of Common Council (5 June) to be re-instated
in office. A committee to whom the matter was
referred reported to the council that they found that
it had been by special command of the late king that
Weld had been prevented carrying out his duties, and
recommended that he should now be restored. The
court, however, seemed loth to re-instate him, and it
was not until after the receipt of a letter from secretary
Nicholas and a writ of restitution had been issued that
it consented (21 Sept.) to re-admit him to office, and
then only by deputy.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 41, fos. 235, 236, 242: Remembrancia, ix, 3 (Index, p. 306);

<p>On the 4th September the king wrote to the City
stating that as by the passing of the Act of Indemnity
many of the aldermen were rendered incapable
of continuing in office, it was his wish that their places
should be filled by restoring those aldermen who had
in times past been removed for their allegiance to him.
As many of the latter had submitted to pay fines
rather than continue in office against their conscience,
he further recommended that these fines should be
returned to them.<note place="foot"><p>Remembrancia, ix, 7 (Index, pp. 8-9). A draft of the king's

released on the following 6th June without any effort
being made on his part. He had afterwards (7 April,
1649) been removed from office with Sir John Gayer,
Alderman Adams and "brother" Bunce by resolution

<p>In the meantime (5 July) the king and parliament
had been entertained at dinner by the City with great
magnificence. The day was unfortunately rainy, and
Pepys, who seems never to have quite forgotten that
he was the son of a tailor, and never put on a new
suit of clothes without recording the fact in his diary,
remarks that the rain that day "spoiled many a fine
suit of clothes." The entertainment on this occasion
took place at the Guildhall instead of at the hall of
one of the great city companies. The mayor took
the opportunity in the course of the dinner to present<pb n="385" /><anchor id="Pg385" />
the king with a "welcome cupp according to the
usuall custome," as a token of loyalty and duty.
On the following day the members of the Common
Council and the masters and wardens of those
companies which had advanced money to defray
the cost of the entertainment dined together in
the hall, when there was "the same musicke as

accepting the City's entertainment and to crave his
pardon for whatever had gone amiss, they took the
opportunity of satisfying him on certain matters—viz.,
the repair of St. Paul's and the building a drawbridge
on London bridge—about which his majesty desired
to be informed. They at the same time reported the
City's choice of Sir Richard Browne to be major-general

<p>On the 14th August a deputation from the Lords

poll tax. The court declined to commit itself to any

on the whole kingdom, and out of which he solemnly
promised, "on the word of a king," that the loan, both

continued; so that when a deputation waited on him

their Irish estates, the following gracious reply was
given:—"That his majesty would perform what his

<p>Thus far all had gone well with Charles. Within
a month of his first letters from Breda he had
recovered his father's throne without shedding one
drop of blood. Of his enemies the more powerful
were either in prison or had fled the country, whilst
others had paid the penalty for their implication in
the death of the late king with their own heads.<pb n="387" /><anchor id="Pg387" />
Danger, however, lurked where least expected. A
small band of fanatics known by the name of Fifth
Monarchy men, who believed in the immediate
coming of Christ upon earth to rule the world, were
in the habit of holding meetings in Coleman Street.
On Sunday, the 6th January, 1661, excited by a
harangue uttered by their leader, a wine-cooper named
Venner, they broke out, and with arms in their hands
hurried to St. Paul's. There they posted sentries, and
demanded of passers-by whom were they for? Upon
one of them replying that he was for King Charles,
he was at once shot by the fanatics, who cried out
that they were for King Jesus. Luckily the city was
at the time in the hands of that staunch soldier Sir
Richard Browne. Upon his appearance on the scene
with an armed force the rioters retreated to Highgate,
but not before they had killed at least half-a-dozen
men. During the next two days the streets were
strongly patrolled; travellers abroad were strictly
examined as to the nature of their business before
being allowed to pass on their way, and suspected
persons were disarmed and compelled to take the
oaths of allegiance and supremacy.<note place="foot"><p>Letter from the lords of the council to the mayor and aldermen,

the return of the rioters was expected, but Monday
and Tuesday passed and none appeared. One of
their meeting houses (probably that in Coleman
Street) was ordered to be pulled down. At six
o'clock on Wednesday morning the inhabitants were
aroused by hearing again the cry of the fanatics, "The
King Jesus and their heads upon the gates," as they
madly attacked the king's life guards. Their whole<pb n="388" /><anchor id="Pg388" />
number, it is said, did not amount to much more than
thirty, of whom twenty were killed, whilst Venner
and nearly all the rest were made prisoners. When
questioned the prisoners one and all refused to make
any confession, saying that they would not betray
the servants of the Lord Jesus.<note place="foot"><p>Sir John Finch to Lord Conway, 11 Jan.—Cal. State Papers Dom.

expiated their crime on the scaffold, and the lord

took the oath of non-resistance, and received the

<p>A few weeks latter (27 Nov.) the streets of the
city again presented a gala appearance, the occasion
being the reception of the Russian ambassador. For
the last three winters there had been, we are told,<pb n="402" /><anchor id="Pg402" />
scarce any frost, and the opening of the year 1662 had
been so exceptionally mild as to cause apprehension
of dearth and disease.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 45, fos. 187-191.</p></note> But now, on the very day
that the Russian ambassador was to pass through the

reminded of his own country by seeing the roofs of
the houses covered with snow.<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 27 Nov., 1662.</p></note> At eight o'clock in

lined with the city trained bands and the king's Lifeguards.
Pepys was there of course; he rarely missed
any sight. He had been disappointed at not getting
a better view of Sir Harry Vane's execution, which
had taken place in June.<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 14 June, 1662.</p></note> This time he was more
fortunate. The ambassador to be sure was late, but
Pepys beguiled the time with dinner. "And after I
had dined"—he records in his diary<note place="foot"><p>Id., 27 Nov., 1662.</p></note>—"I walked to
the conduit in the quarrefowr, at the end of Gracious
Street and Cornhill and there (the spouts thereof
running very near me, upon all the people that were
under it) I saw them pretty well, go by." He
failed to catch sight of the ambassador himself, but
was struck with the handsome appearance of the
ambassador's attendants, most of whom carried hawks
on their "fists" as a present to Charles. The
strangeness of this sight caused the mob to jeer, upon
which the diarist characteristically remarks, "but
lord! to see the absurd nature of Englishmen that<pb n="403" /><anchor id="Pg403" />

<p>Notwithstanding the supplies voted to him by

Charles was continually in want of money. In
November, 1662, he had sold Dunkirk to the French
king for £200,000, much to the disgust of the English
nation. Nevertheless, his extravagance soon reduced
him to want, and by the following September (1663)
he was in such straits that he sent to the City to
borrow the comparatively small sum of £50,000.
Seeing that the City had so recently received a

<p>On the 29th October the new lord mayor, Sir

the customary procession and pageant, followed by a

the occasion of what appears on the face of it to have
been a studied insult offered—not by the municipal
authorities, but by the lord chancellor, the bishops and
lords of the council—to the French ambassador.
Whether the lord chancellor and other high officers of
state arrived at the Guildhall before their time, or the
French ambassador came late, one cannot say. But,
however that may have been, it appears that on the
latter's arrival the others had already commenced

the municipal authorities, who had not yet taken their

he left the hall to go home and dine by himself, in
spite of every endeavour on the part of the civic
officials to smooth matters over. Two hours later the
sheriffs presented themselves at the ambassador's
house, accompanied by a deputation from the Common
Council, for the purpose of offering excuses for the
recent <foreign lang="fr" rend="font-style: italic">contretemps</foreign>. The excuses they had to offer
were, however, of the lamest character, as the
ambassador took care to show. Firstly, they said
they had been taken by surprise. This was
manifestly false, as the ambassador attended at
the Guildhall upon invitation. They next pleaded
ignorance and incapacity in receiving one of so
high degree, when the ambassador reminded them
that they had recently done honour to the Spanish
ambassador; and lastly they endeavoured to throw
the whole of the blame upon the master of the
ceremonies. This excuse, however, like the others,
was easily shown to be false, inasmuch as that official
was personally engaged in escorting the ambassador
to the Guildhall and had nothing to do with the
banquet. The deputation thereupon withdrew, being
all the more discomforted by the excess of courtesy
shown to them by the ambassador, who himself
insisted on escorting them to the door (<foreign lang="fr" rend="font-style: italic">je leur dis que

<p>Such a victory at another time would have been
hailed with unbounded joy. As it was the enthusiasm
of the citizens was damped by the presence among
them of the most awful scourge that had ever yet
visited the city. Towards the close of 1663 there
had been rumours of an outbreak of plague on the
continent, and more especially at Amsterdam and
Hamburgh. The king communicated with the lord<pb n="410" /><anchor id="Pg410" />
mayor to learn what measures had formerly been
taken in like case to prevent the spread of infection.
It was suggested by the Court of Aldermen that, after
the custom of other countries, vessels coming from
infected parts should perform quarantine at Gravesend
or the neighbourhood, where a lazaretto should be
established. The proposal was accepted,<note place="foot"><p>Secretary Morrice to the lord mayor, 18 Oct., 1663; the lord

precautions, taken on the instigation of the city
authorities, was largely due the immunity from
infection which the city enjoyed for the next fifteen
months. In June, 1664, the lords of the council
adopted similar precautions as their own and wrote to
the lord mayor, in view of the increase of the plague
in the Netherlands, desiring him "by all waies and
meanes possible to be careful that no person or
persons, goods or merchandises whatsoever be
permitted to be received or harboured within the
citty of London which come from Holland, Zealand
or any other places infected with the plague,

<p>The plague made its first appearance in the city
in June, 1665. The atmosphere had been very
sultry—the 7th June being recorded by Pepys as the
hottest day he had ever felt in his life—and the heat
caused the infection to spread among the crowded
population of the city with amazing rapidity. Many<pb n="411" /><anchor id="Pg411" />
followed the example set by the king and court and
fled to the country.<note place="foot"><p>Van Goch (or Gogh) to the States General, 24 July.—Cal. State

the city without giving notice of some reasonable
cause, those who had already absented themselves
being ordered to return.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 70, fo. 141.</p></note> The good example thus set
was unhappily not followed by the city rectors.
Many of them, to their shame, forsook their cures
in abject fear, leaving their parishioners to die
without the consolations of the Church, whilst
their pulpits were seized upon by Presbyterian
ministers, who embraced the opportunity of publicly
declaiming against the sins of the court and the
ill usage to which they had been compelled to
submit.<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, i, 411.</p></note> The first Wednesday of every month was

and taverns kept open only for citizens. The
streets were cleansed and kept free from vagrant

Nevertheless, the death rate rapidly increased.
Pest-houses or hospitals were opened and the
best medical aid supplied, whilst subscriptions
were set on foot for the benefit of the poor.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 70, fos. 136, 136b, 143b, 144, 144b, 147, 150b, 151;

The number of deaths that occurred outside the city,

larger than of those within the city's walls. Thus for

with the view of purifying the atmosphere.<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 6 and 20 Sept.</p></note> When

supply of earth. Small wonder if complaints were
made to the Court of Aldermen of noisome smells
arising from the churchyard of St. Mary's Bethlem.
The court immediately (5 Sept.) gave orders for
remedying the evil. No more pits were to be dug,
but each corpse was to occupy a separate grave, fresh
mould was to be laid over places complained of, and
bones and coffin-boards found above ground were to
be interred in the middle of the churchyard.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 70, fo. 153b.</p></note></p>

<p>The worst was now over. From the middle of
September the number of deaths in the city began to
decrease almost as rapidly as they had risen. In the
first week in November there was a sudden increase
on the return of the previous week, but in the
following week there was again a fall, and this
continued until in the first week of December the
deaths in the city numbered only twenty-four.
Nevertheless it was thought advisable to prohibit
the usual entertainments which took place after the
wardmote elections on St. Thomas's day, in order to
minimise the risk of infection.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 46, fo. 97b.</p></note> The mayor was
justified in taking this precaution, for the very next
week the number of deaths more than doubled itself
(57). That the city of London was at this time one
of the healthiest places in the kingdom is shown by
the fact that just as it was one of the last places
attacked by the plague, so it was one of the first
to become free, in spite of its having been made
"the receptacle of all the people from all infected
places."<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 6 Aug., 1666.</p></note></p>

<p>The total number of victims in the city proper
during the twelve month ending the 19th December,
1665, is officially given as 9,887. When we consider
that the entire population within the city walls—comprising
an area of one square mile, more or
less—could scarcely have reached 100,000,<note place="foot"><p>The number of inhabitants of the city <emph>and its liberties</emph> in the reign

city would become less. Hence, in 1682, the city's Recorder, speaking
on the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign> case, mentions the number of inhabitants for
whom the municipal authorities had to supply markets as a little over

<p>Whilst the plague was raging the English fleet
had remained in the Thames, leaving the Dutch
masters of the sea. The opening of the new year
(1666) found England engaged in a war with France,
as well as with the Dutch. Louis, however, was
content to leave the English and the Dutch to settle
matters between themselves at sea. On the 1st June
a desperate naval battle commenced off the North
Foreland and continued for four days, at the end of
which neither party could claim a victory. Both
fleets withdrew for repairs. It was at this crisis that
the "Loyal London" was hastily launched and application
made to the city for a loan of £100,000. The
money was readily voted, contrary to expectations.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 46, fo. 99; Letter Book WW, fo. 78; Pepys, Diary,

<p>When the last instalment (£1,500) of the loan
was paid into the exchequer, the Guildhall and its
surroundings were being threatened with destruction
by the Great Fire,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 71, fo. 172b.</p></note> which, breaking out on the night
of Saturday, 1st September, 1666, or early on Sunday
morning, at a baker's shop in Pudding Lane, within
five days reduced the greater part of the city to ashes.
The king had long ago anticipated such a calamity,
arising from the narrowness of the streets and the
overhanging houses built for the most part of wood.
More than a year before (11 April, 1665) he had written
to the mayor, recorder and aldermen of the city<note place="foot"><p>Cal. State Papers Dom. (1664-1665), p. 303.</p></note>
warning them of the danger and recommending a<pb n="415" /><anchor id="Pg415" />
more diligent execution of the Act for the repair of
highways and sewers. He authorised them to imprison
such persons as, after due warning, continued
to erect buildings in contravention of the Act, and to
pull the buildings down. He further desired them to
open Temple Bar and the passage and gatehouse of
Cheapside in St. Paul's Churchyard, as mentioned in
the Act, and he would himself inspect what progress
was being made in carrying out these improvements.
He concluded by declaring that he had made the city
his royal residence,<note place="foot"><p>Charles II is said to have been the last English sovereign to
occupy rooms in the Tower of London, as he did on the night previous
to his coronation.</p></note> and had received from it such
marks of loyalty and affection as would ever make
him concerned for its wealth, trade, reputation, beauty
and convenience.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the fire at first caused no uneasiness,
such sights being only too common. But
when no less than 300 houses had been destroyed
within a few hours, and the flames, carried by a
strong east wind that prevailed, threatened others,
the inhabitants began to take alarm. The mayor, Sir
Thomas Bludworth, was early on the scene, but he
lacked decision of character and failed to keep his
head. He endeavoured to carry out the king's orders
by pulling down houses to prevent the fire spreading,
but as often as not he was overtaken by the flames.
"Lord, what can I do?" he lack-a-daisically exclaimed
in answer to a message from the king; "I
am spent; people will not obey me. I have been
pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us
faster than we can do it."<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 2 Sept., 1666.</p></note> The inhabitants were<pb n="416" /><anchor id="Pg416" />
too busy removing their furniture and effects to a
place of safety to render much assistance to the
mayor, but he found willing hands in the soldiers
supplied by the king and the Duke of York, both
of whom displayed great personal energy. "The
Duke of York," wrote an eye-witness of the mournful
scene,<note place="foot"><p>Letter of John Rushworth, 8 Sept., 1666.—"Notes and Queries,"
5th series, v. 307.</p></note> "hath wonn the hearts of the people w<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>

man that did assist; if the lord maior had done
as much his example might have gone far towards
saveing the citty."</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The extent of the ravages of the fire.</p></note>

<p>In spite of every effort to stay its progress the
fire continued to rage throughout the whole of Monday
and Tuesday. By this time Lombard Street,
Cannon Street and Gracechurch Street had been
reduced to ashes. The houses on London Bridge
were attacked and Southwark threatened with destruction.
On Wednesday the flames devastated
Cornhill and the Exchange. The following day they
got hold of St. Paul's (at that time undergoing repairs
and surrounded with scaffolding), and were carried by
the east wind towards the Temple and Hatton Garden.
The brick buildings of the Temple offered a
more stubborn resistance than the wooden buildings
of the city, and prevented the fire spreading further
westward.<note place="foot"><p>"London's lamentation on its destruction by a consuming fire,
began Sept. 1, 1666...."—Cal. State Papers Dom. (1666-1667),
p. 103 and Preface, pp. x, xi.</p></note> In the meantime resort was had to gunpowder
for the quicker destruction of houses in the<pb n="417" /><anchor id="Pg417" />
city, and by this means much was eventually saved
which otherwise would inevitably have been lost. But
this was not done without considerable opposition from
the owners of houses who objected to their property
being blown up if there was a chance of it being saved.<note place="foot"><p>Pepys, Diary, 4 Sept., 1666; Evelyn, Diary, i, 393.</p></note>
At last the "horrid, malicious, bloody flame," described
by Pepys as so unlike the flame of an ordinary
fire, burnt itself out, and at the close of Thursday,
the 6th September, the inhabitants of the city were
able for the first time since the outbreak to seek a
night's rest without fear of further danger. When
they rose the next morning and contemplated the
extent of the havoc wrought on their city by the
fire, the hearts of many must have fairly sunk
within them. At least four-fifths of the whole of the
buildings situate within the walls had been reduced to
ashes. The official report was that no less than
13,200 houses and eighty-nine parish churches, besides
St. Paul's and divers chapels, were destroyed, and
that only seventy-five acres out of a total of 373 acres
of ground within the walls escaped the conflagration.<note place="foot"><p>"History of the Monument," by Charles Welch, F.S.A., Librarian
to the Corporation of London, 1893, p. 79.</p></note>
These seventy-five acres chiefly lay in the vicinity of
Aldgate and Tower Hill, and probably owed their
immunity from the fire to the free use of gunpowder,
for it was in Tower Street, Pepys tells us, that the
practice of blowing up houses began. Most of the
livery companies lost their halls. Clothworkers' Hall
burned for three days and three nights, the flames
being fed with the oil that was stored in its cellars.
The Leaden Hall was partly saved. Gresham House<pb n="418" /><anchor id="Pg418" />
also escaped; but the Guildhall suffered severely,
its outer walls only being left standing.</p>

and when Michaelmas-day arrived, and he was about
to go out of office, he was called to account for his
conduct. In anticipation of lord mayor's day he wrote
to Joseph Williamson, afterwards Secretary of State,
bespeaking his favour and support. He professed not
to live by popular applause (he said), but he needed

<note place="margin"><p>The fire attributed to the Papists.</p></note>

<p>As to the origin of the fire the wildest rumours
at the time prevailed, and for years afterwards it was

the fact that not a scintilla of evidence was
forthcoming in support of such a charge, after a most
careful investigation.<note place="foot"><p>Memorandum [by Williamson] that after careful examinations by

a scheme for re-building the city, and on the 21st
September he presented to the Common Council
"an exquisite modell or draught" which found much
favour with the court.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 46, fo. 121.</p></note> Early in the following
month (4 Oct.) the Common Council was informed
that for the greater expedition in carrying out the<pb n="428" /><anchor id="Pg428" />
work of re-building the city, the king had appointed
Wren and two others to make a survey, with the
assistance of such surveyors and workmen as the civic
authorities should nominate. The city's choice fell
upon Robert Hooke, described as "Reader of the
Mathematicks in Gresham Colledge," Peter Mills and
Edward Jermyn or Jarman. By way of preparation
for the survey, the owners of houses that had been
destroyed were again ordered (9 Oct.) to clear their
foundations of rubbish, and to pile up the bricks
and stones within fourteen days, so that every man's
property might be "more exactly measured and
asserted."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 46, fo. 123.</p></note></p>

<p>The impracticability of re-building the city except
on old foundations soon become manifest, and the
handsome design which Wren prepared had to be
dismissed. There was difficulty enough as it was,
and the four sworn viewers of the city whose duty at
ordinary times was to guard against encroachments
and other nuisances were unusually busy. Sometimes
the old foundations proved too weak to support a new
building, sometimes the new building threatened to
encroach on the public thoroughfare. Such matters
required the constant attention of the viewers. Disputes
would also arise between the landlords and
tenants of houses destroyed by the fire. In order to
settle all differences that arose, a special Court of
Judicature was established by Act of Parliament
(31 Jan., 1667).<note place="foot"><p>Stat. 19 Car. II, c. 2.</p></note> The court sat at Clifford's Inn, and

the judges were painted by Michael Wright, by the order of the Court
of Aldermen, 19 April, 1670 (Repertory 75, fo. 160b). Warrants for
the payment of the artist, and also Jeremiah Wright for painting arms
and inscriptions on the frames, are preserved in the Chamberlain's

in getting this Act passed, and pressed the judges to
give the Bill all dispatch they could, "as a matter of
principal concernment and encouragement to the

<p>It was not deemed in any way derogatory in

therefore to find that whilst this and other Bills in
which the City was interested were before Parliament,
the Court of Aldermen voted a sum of £100 in gold as
a gift to the Speaker of the House of Commons,
"as a loving remembrance from this court for his

<p>Whilst a Bill for re-building the city was being
prepared for parliament the civic authorities were
busy considering how to find the money necessary
for re-building the Guildhall, the city's gates, the
prisons and other public buildings. On the 6th
November (1666) the Court of Aldermen resolved
to sit every Wednesday afternoon at the house of
the new lord mayor (Sir William Bolton) to consider
this important question, and to continue such weekly
sittings until the matter was settled.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 2.</p></note>  It was not<pb n="430" /><anchor id="Pg430" />

for an imposition of twelve pence a chaldron
on coals brought into the Port of London, wherewith
to meet the expense. The advice and assistance
of the solicitor-general and of Sir Job Charlton
were to be solicited, and £10 in "old gold" given
to each of them, in addition to "such other charges
and rewards" as might be necessary for the furtherance
of the business.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 72, fo. 8.</p></note> Later on the court resolved
to approach the Lord Chancellor and to entreat him

the Common Council had agreed to certain "heads

Bill was brought in and read the first time.</p>

<p>For fear lest some of the clauses might offend
the king a petition was drawn up for presentation to
his majesty, in which matters were explained, and his
majesty's favourable interpretation and pardon asked
for anything omitted in the Bill or done amiss.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 136.</p></note> A
report had got abroad that the City had caused a
clause to be inserted in the Bill forbidding any one
to engage in building operations who refused to
abjure the Covenant. This made the Common
Council very angry, and the mayor and sheriffs were
desired to investigate the matter.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 137.</p></note> On the 5th

<pb n="431" /><anchor id="Pg431" />

<p>In the meantime the Court of Aldermen had drafted
(22 Jan.) a petition to the king for permission to
introduce a Bill for an impost on coals, to assist
the City in re-building the conduits, aqueducts and
other public works, as it had "no common stock,

<p>On the 12th March certain proposals for widening
streets which had received the approval of the
Common Council were submitted to Charles at a
council held at Berkshire House, now Cleveland
House, St. James's. On the following day they
were returned to the Common Council with his
majesty's recommendations and suggestions thereon.
The same day (13 March), the City nominated Peter
Mills, Edward Jarman, Robert Hooke and John
Oliver to be surveyors and supervisors of the houses
about to be re-built; the king's commissioners,

<p>In September the king suggested the appointment
of Sir William Bolton, the lord mayor, as surveyor-general
for the re-building of the city. The suggestion
was referred to a committee, who reported to the
Common Council (25 Oct.) their opinion that there
was "noe use or occasion for a surveyor-generall," as
the work could be well and sufficiently managed by
the surveyors already appointed.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 46, fos. 170b, 189. According to the evidence of the
State Papers the king appears to have suggested Bolton's appointment
as surveyor-general by letters to the Common Council, dated the 31st
May and the 5th June, 1667 (Cal. State Papers Dom., 1667, pp. 133,
151). It does not, however, appear to have been considered by the
Common Council until the 14th Sept. There may have been good
reason for the City declining to place the mayor in such a responsible
position of trust, for a few weeks later (3 Dec.) he was suspected of
misappropriating money subscribed to assist the poor of the city, and
pending enquiry was forbidden to attend the Court of Aldermen or
any public function (Repertory 73, fos. 28b, 61, 93b, 95, 95b, 107b).
After bringing a charge against the Bishop of London in September,
1668, of misappropriating the sum of £50, and afterwards withdrawing,
he was himself convicted in 1675 of having embezzled large sums of
money intended for the poor (Repertory 73, fos. 260b, 264, 292b, 303;
Repertory 80, fo. 119b). Reduced to poverty, he was granted by the
City an allowance of £3 a week, which after his decease was continued
to his widow (Journal 49, fo. 100b).</p></note></p>

for the east end of the city, Honey Lane for the

to take the place of Newgate Market, for the west

fruit markets, viz., the site of the king's wardrobe (if
the king would give his consent) and the ground
whereon recently had stood the church of St. Laurence
Pulteney. The markets formerly held in Aldersgate
Street and Gracechurch Street were to be discontinued.
A place was to be found at or near Christ Church as
a site for the meat market, hitherto kept in Newgate
market. These suggestions were with slight alteration
accepted in the following February (1668), when

<p>Above all there was a lack of money to pay the

more is not surprising when we consider what had
been the state of trade during the last three years.

<p>The lull in the storm afforded the municipal
authorities an opportunity of taking stock of their own
Chamber. To this end a committee was appointed
on the 12th February, 1668. For nine months that
committee was employed examining the state of
the City's finances, and then had not finished their
task. Nevertheless, on the 23rd November they
made a report to the Common Council of the result
of their labours so far as they had gone.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 46, fo. 251.</p></note> The state
of the Chamber, they said, was so low that it would
require the utmost care and industry to restore it and
save it from utter decay and ruin, "for what by misemployment
of the treasure in the late troubles
and other ill managements," as well as by extraordinary
expenses occasioned by the Plague and Fire,
the City's debt had still increased notwithstanding
its income having been largely augmented by fines of
aldermen and chamber and bridge-house leases, which
within the last fifteen years had exceeded £200,000.
It was clear that when these extraordinary accessories
to the City's income ceased—and they had already
begun to decline—the City's debt would increase and
would indeed become desperate unless some remedy
were found. The committee, therefore, made certain<pb n="439" /><anchor id="Pg439" />
suggestions with the view of cutting down expenses.
The City Chronologer,<note place="foot"><p>What his duties were is a matter of surmise. The office was
successively held by Thomas Middleton, Ben Jonson and Francis
Quarles. Ben Jonson's salary (100 nobles per annum) was stopped
in 1631 by order of the Court of Aldermen "until he shall have presented
to the court some fruits of his labours in that place" (Repertory
46, fo. 8); but it was renewed in 1634 at the intervention of the king

Waits, which had lately been increased, should be
reduced to its former amount. Some saving might
be made in allowance of stationery in the various
offices, in expenses attending Courts of Conservancy,
in allowance of boots to City labourers and artificers.
The personal expenses of the City's Remembrancer for
diet, coach hire, boat hire, etc., should be no longer
allowed; and the Chamber should not be called upon
to make any disbursement for military purposes
beyond the sum of £4,666 13<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> 4<abbr rend="font-style: italic">d.</abbr>, for which the
City was yearly liable by Act of Parliament. Lastly,
neither the court of Aldermen nor the court of
Common Council ought to have power to draw upon
the Chamber for a sum exceeding £500, except it
were in connection with the re-building of the Guildhall
and other specified objects. These and other
recommendations of the committee, being carefully
considered by the court, were for the most part
accepted with certain amendments.</p>

brought them into close relation with the Crown.
A goldsmith by trade, he, like others of his class, took
to keeping "running cashes" and transacting generally
the business of a banker at his house known as the
"Unicorn" in Lombard Street. Pepys mentions him
frequently in his Diary. In the days of the Commonwealth
he was paymaster of the garrison at Dunkirk,
and continued to act as financial agent in all matters
connected with that town until it was sold to the
French king. His house in Lombard Street having
perished in the Great Fire, he was, by the king's
special command, accommodated with lodgings in
Gresham College, in order that his business relations
with the king might not be interrupted pending the
re-building of his premises.<note place="foot"><p>The king to Dr. Goddard, 10 Sept., 1666.—Cal. State Papers

<index index="toc" level1="The Lord Mayor assaulted in the Temple." /><note place="margin"><p>The rights of the mayor within the precincts of the Temple.</p></note>

<p>In March, 1669, a riot occurred in the Temple on
the occasion of the mayor and aldermen going to dine
with the reader of the Inner Temple. The question
whether the Temple is situate within the city and
liberties or not was then a debateable one, whatever it
may be at the present day. The lord mayor of that time
(William Turner) evidently thought that it lay within
his jurisdiction, and insisted upon being preceded by
the city's sword-bearer carrying the sword up. To this
the students strongly objected. The story, as told by
Pepys, is to the effect that on Wednesday, 3rd March,<pb n="441" /><anchor id="Pg441" />
"my lord mayor being invited this day to dinner at
the readers at the Temple, and endeavouring to
carry his sword up, the students did pull it down,
and forced him to go and stay all the day in a private
counsellor's chamber until the reader himself could
get the young gentlemen to dinner; and then my
lord mayor did retreat out of the Temple by stealth
with his sword up. This do make great heat among
the students, and my lord mayor did send to the
king, and also I hear that Sir Richard Browne did
cause the drums to beat for the trained bands;
but all is over, only I hear that the students do
resolve to try the charter of the city." From a
draft report<note place="foot"><p>Preserved in the Town Clerk's office.</p></note> of the incident which was probably made
for the purpose of being laid before the Council
Board,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory, 74, fo. 116.</p></note> we learn that as soon as the civic procession
entered the Temple cloisters it was met by a man
named Hodges and others coming down the back
stairs of the Inner Temple Hall; that Hodges
threatened the lord mayor if he would not take
down his sword, declaring that the Temple was excepted
out of the city's charter, that the sword was
not the king's sword, but the lord mayor's, and that
"they were as good men as he, and no respect was
to be given him there." A struggle then took place
for the possession of the sword, in which the sword-bearer
was slightly hurt and some of the pearls from
the scabbard were lost. The students made a snatch at
the "cap of maintenance" worn by the sword-bearer.
The marshal's men who were in attendance suffered
some rough treatment, and narrowly escaped being<pb n="442" /><anchor id="Pg442" />
put under the pump. The mayor and aldermen in
the meanwhile sought refuge in the chambers of Mr.
Auditor Phillips, and awaited the return of Sir John
Nicholas, who with the recorder and the sheriffs had
been despatched to Whitehall to report the matter to
the king. As soon as they returned the mayor and
aldermen essayed to make their way out of the
Temple, but were again opposed by the students, with
Hodges at their head. The scene was one of wild
excitement and confusion; blows were showered upon
the aldermen, and one of the sheriffs was seized by
the collar in the frantic attempts of the students to
pull down the sword. The mayor and aldermen were
called "cuckolds," and their officers "dogs, rogues,
rascals and other very bad names." Some of the
students are said to have had weapons concealed under
their gowns, and to have threatened to draw them.
The sheriffs, the recorder and Sir John Nicholas having
again been sent to the king, it was intimated to the
mayor by some of the benchers, and by Mr. Goodfellow,
the Reader, at whose invitation the civic fathers
were in the Temple, that he might now leave without
any interruption (the "young gentlemen," according
to Pepys, had been persuaded to go to dinner), which,
after some display of opposition, he was allowed to do.
Such is the City's own version of the affair, which
concludes with the remark "that the proceedings
aforesaid were greatly affrontive and dishonourable
to the government of the city," a remark with
which most people will be disposed to agree. Nor is
it surprising to find that two years later the mayor
and aldermen declined a similar invitation from
Sir Francis North to attend his "feast" at the<pb n="443" /><anchor id="Pg443" />

threatened if the sword should be borne up before his

£60,000.<note place="foot"><p>2 July.—Journal 47, fo. 55; Letter Book XX, fo. 46.</p></note> He had recently entered into a secret
treaty with France (1 June), whereby he had pledged

in return for pecuniary support. The City agreed

required it became necessary to draw upon the coal
dues.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 75, fo. 268, 289.</p></note> Much opposition was raised to the loan by

In addition to the loan by the City Charles obtained
considerable supplies from parliament when
it met in the autumn. The House had been kept in
complete ignorance of the arrangement that had
been made with France, and voted the money on
the understanding that it would be used in assisting
the Dutch against Louis and not Louis against the

<p>As soon as parliament had voted supplies it was
prorogued (11 Dec.), Charles and his "cabal" being
determined to have no restraint put upon them in
carrying out the terms of the shameful treaty with
France. No long time elapsed before they had to
face the difficulty of an empty exchequer. It was
useless to declare war without funds. Charles was at
his wits' end for money and promised high office to
any one who should point out a successful way of
raising it. Clifford and Ashley, two members of the
cabal, put their heads together and hit upon the bold
plan of declaring a <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">moratorium</foreign>, or suspension of payments
out of the royal exchequer. For many years
past it had been the custom for the goldsmiths of
London and others who had been in the habit of
keeping the money of private individuals, either on
deposit or running account, to lend it to the king, who
could afford to pay them a higher rate of interest than
they paid to their private customers. The money was
paid into the exchequer, the bankers taking assignments
of the public revenue for payment of principal
and interest, as it came in. Most of this money had
already been spent by Charles in paying off the fleet
that brought him over, and in carrying on the late war
with the Dutch;<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, "Hist. of His Own Time," i, 560. Burnet omits to mention
the sums lavished on his mistresses and illegitimate children.</p></note> but the bankers and capitalists who
had provided the money were content to abide by the<pb n="445" /><anchor id="Pg445" />
king's frequent assurance that he would continue to
make good all assignments until their whole debt
should be wiped out. We may judge therefore of
their surprise and disappointment when they learnt,
as they did on the 2nd January, 1672, that the king
proposed to suspend all payments out of the public
revenue for one whole year!</p>

<note place="margin"><p>London bankers brought to bankruptcy.</p></note>

<p>It is true that he promised to add the interest
then due to the capital and to allow six per cent.
interest on the whole as some compensation to his
creditors for the delay; but this, even if carried into
practice, proved unavailing to ward off disaster.
The inevitable crash came. Many of the London
bankers, and among them Alderman Backwell, who
held revenue assignments exceeding a quarter of a
million sterling, were made utterly bankrupt. A few
of them who had interest at court got wind of the
threatened danger and managed to withdraw their
money from the exchequer in time, whilst Shaftesbury,
one of the prime movers in closing the exchequer,
foreseeing the inevitable result, took all of his own
money out of his banker's hands and warned his friends
to do the same.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Renewal of Dutch War." /><note place="margin"><p>Declaration of war with the Dutch, 17 March, 1672.</p></note>

<p>The exchequer having been in this way made
richer by £1,300,000, Charles was prepared to declare
war. An attempt to intercept a fleet of Dutch merchantmen
before any declaration of war had been
made—a piratical act admitting of no possible justification—brought
matters to a climax and war was
declared (17 March, 1672) by England and France.
The 27th March was appointed by royal proclamation
to be kept as a solemn fast for the purpose of begging
the Almighty's blessing on his majesty's forces, the<pb n="446" /><anchor id="Pg446" />

<note place="margin"><p>Parliament and the Test Act, 1673.</p></note>

<p>The war, which was chiefly remarkable for the
noble stand made by the Dutch under the young
William, Prince of Orange, Charles's own nephew and
afterwards King of England, soon drained the king's
resources, and once more he had to face a parliament.
The parliament, which met on the 4th February, 1673,
showed itself willing to vote a subsidy of £70,000 a
month for a period of eighteen months, but only on its
own terms. These were (1) the repeal of the Declaration
of Indulgence which Charles, who was beginning to
show signs of favouring the Roman Church, had by a
stretch of prerogative recently caused to be issued, and
(2) the passing of a Test Act which should bind all public
officers to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance,
receive the sacrament, and abjure the doctrine of
transubstantiation. By this means parliament hoped
to maintain the supremacy of the Church.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The City in arrears with assessments.</p></note>

<p>The assessments which the City was now called
upon to pay were far beyond its powers, seeing that
many merchants and traders who had left the
city at the time of the Plague and Fire refused to
return, preferring to live in the suburbs, and thus a
large number of the houses that had recently been
re-built were left unoccupied. Every exertion was
made to get some remission of the burden, but
although the king signified his intention of making
some abatement, little appears to have been done.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 78, fos. 95b. 98b, 136b; Journal 47, fo. 264b; Letter

<p>In March of this year (1673) an individual

for raising money by way of annuities to be granted
by the city to every subscriber of £20 or more.<note place="foot"><p>"An advertisem<hi rend="vertical-align: super">t</hi> and demonstracon concerning y<hi rend="vertical-align: super">e</hi> improvem<hi rend="vertical-align: super">t</hi>

The matter was in the first instance brought before
the Court of Aldermen, who, upon consideration,
declared that the proposal appeared to them "very
faire and reasonable, and in all likelihood of very
great advantage to the city," and forthwith resolved
themselves into a committee of the whole court to
treat with Cardonel and take such further proceedings
as might be thought requisite.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 78, fos. 120, 123b.</p></note> In the following

<p>By February of the next year (1674) trade had

to seek some relief from parliament. An address<pb n="448" /><anchor id="Pg448" />
was accordingly drawn up, setting forth the miserable
state to which the city had been reduced by the
ravages of the plague and the fire, the increase of
new buildings in the suburbs, which not only injured
the trade of the city, but afforded a retreat for
disorderly persons, and excessive taxation (the city
being called upon to pay the same amount of taxes
as in its most prosperous days), and praying the
Commons to apply some timely remedy. The address
was to have been laid before the house on Monday,
the 23rd February,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 48, fos. 19, 23b; Letter Book YY, fos. 15, 19b.</p></note> but no mention of it appears in

<p>In September (1674) the old question again

The question had arisen, it will be remembered, in
January, 1649,<note place="foot"><p>Objection appears to have been raised for the first time four years
before (Jan., 1645).—Repertory 57 (Pt. 2), fo. 45b; Journal 40, fo.

and left the Common Council, followed by the
aldermen, and the court, instead of breaking up
according to custom, proceeded to pass measures in
their absence. Its action on this occasion was
reported to parliament, and the house signified its
approval of the court's proceedings and passed an
ordinance which practically deprived the Court of
Aldermen of all control over the Common Council.
Since that time the matter had remained dormant, until
jealousy between the two bodies was again excited by
the Common Council passing an Act (17 Sept., 1674)
for compelling the aldermen to reside within the city<pb n="449" /><anchor id="Pg449" />
under the penalty of a fine of £500.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 48, fo. 90b; Letter Book YY, fo. 62b.</p></note> Against the
passing of any such Act the Recorder, on behalf of

to the Common Council, and the Commons as
formerly protested against that protest (13 Nov.).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 48, fo. 122; Letter Book YY, fo. 71b.</p></note></p>

<p>It was not that the mayor and aldermen were
not fully conscious of the mischief arising from their
own non-residence in the city, for they themselves
passed an order for every alderman to return with
his family into the city before the following Easter on
pain of heavy penalty,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 80, fos. 17b-18.</p></note> but they objected to the court

<note place="margin"><p>Report to Court of Aldermen <emph>re</emph> veto, 20 Oct., 1674.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime the Court of Aldermen had
appointed a committee (24 Sept.) to examine the
question of the right of veto, and this committee had
reported (20 Oct.) in favour of the court.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 79, fos. 377, 405b-407b.</p></note> "We
find," said the committee, "that the court of Common
Council hath always consisted, and still it doth,
of three distinct degrees of persons, viz., of the lord
mayor in the first place as the chefe magistrate,
and secondly of the aldermen as subordinate
magistrates, and thirdly of the commons, or of a
select number of the commons representing all
the commoners of the said city as now is, and
for a long time before hath been used." In
this respect the committee proceeded to say, "the
Common Councill of the city doth much resemble
the constitution of the Common Council of the
kingdom, and we further find that the order of<pb n="450" /><anchor id="Pg450" />
proceeding in the making of lawes for the good
government of the citty doth imitate the paterne
sett them by the High Court of Parliament, in
making lawes for the government of the nation, in
regard that noe ordinance made in the Common
Councell of this city can be a binding law to any
without the joint consent and concurrence of the
Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen and commoners in
Common Councell assembled, they having a joynt
power and equal authority in making of lawes. So
that the mayor and aldermen cannot impose upon
the commoners, nor <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">e converso</foreign>; each degree having
a power to dissent or assent as to them seems best."</p>

<p>The committee next pointed out how Bills for
the better government of the city had formerly
originated for the most part with the mayor and
aldermen, and had been by them transmitted to the
Common Council, where, after being read in two
several courts (and not twice in one court) and
assented to, they became complete acts and binding
laws. Such had been the usual and salient practice.
Nevertheless, the committee had found that sometimes
the Common Council had petitioned the Court
of Aldermen for redress of certain grievances and the
latter had complied with such petitions, "and so
sometimes Acts of Common Council have been
made at the desire of the lord mayor and aldermen
signifyed to the commons by the Recorder." The
conclusion that the committee arrived at was that
"the lord mayor and aldermen have negative votes
as the commoners also have, and contrary to this
order of proceeding in making Acts of Common
Council wee cannot find any presedent."</p>

<p>On the 13th November a joint Committee of
Aldermen and Commoners was appointed by the
Common Council to search the city's Records as to

report thereon.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 48, fo. 122.</p></note> Four days later (17 Nov.) the

shortly afterwards called to account. His defence
was that he only obeyed the wishes of the majority;

and the Common Sergeant had by command appeared

difference existing between the Aldermen and
the Common Council; that the Common Sergeant being
asked to whom it devolved to put the question on a
debate in council, had in the Recorder's hearing
replied to the effect "that the question had always
been used to be put by the lord mayor or by his
lordship's appointment and not otherwise, so far as he
had observed," and he had never known the matter
disputed; that he had then likewise declared to his
majesty that he was "sorry for his deportment at the
last Common Council, saying that what he did was
a sudden act and rashly done without any intention
to make any disturbance, and that he would freely
acknowledge the same wheresoever his majesty
should command him"; that therefore his majesty
had commanded the Recorder to acquaint the court
that the best expedient he could suggest, as the case<pb n="453" /><anchor id="Pg453" />
stood, for a settlement of the difficulty, was that the
old order of things should be re-established, that
(among other things) the suspension of the Common
Sergeant should be removed, and that the books and
records of the city should be searched by six such
aldermen as the lord mayor should appoint, and six
such commoners as the Common Council should
appoint, in order to satisfy themselves of the respective
privileges of the lord mayor and aldermen and commons
in Common Council assembled, and to settle
the same in a quiet and peaceable manner if they
could. Failing this his majesty would appoint a
judge to arbitrate in the matter.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Jeffreys restored, 30 March, 1675.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime Charles had concluded a separate
treaty with the Dutch (19 Feb., 1674), who
continued to struggle manfully against the French
king, with such assistance as they derived from the
emperor and the German states. The Commons were
fearful of entrusting the king with either money or
troops lest he should employ them against the Dutch,
or against their own liberties. The successes of Louis
at length provoked a general cry for war against
France, and the Commons went so far as to pass a
bill (8 March, 1678) imposing a poll tax as part of the
supply.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ix, 451.</p></note> Charles lost no time in applying to the City

another £50,000. This, too, was granted (14 May);<note place="foot"><p>Journal 48, fo. 380.</p></note>
and Charles, in order to show his displeasure with the
Commons, resorted to his usual tactics and prorogued
parliament, but only for ten days.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, ix, 480.</p></note> A few days after
the Commons had again met they resolved (27 May)
that if the king would declare war against France they
would give him their hearty support, otherwise they
would at once proceed to take into consideration the

to Burnet ("Hist. of His Own Time," ii, 173, 174), the House refused

into the Chamber of London, and named a committee for "breaking"
the army.</p></note> The disbandment
did not take place, however, but in its

<p>Just when the war was brought so unexpectedly
to an end Charles signified his desire for another loan
by the City to the extent of £200,000. The matter
was brought to the notice of the Common Council
on the last day of July, and on the 1st August the
lord mayor issued his precept to the aldermen of the
several wards to invite subscriptions.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 48, fos. 406, 408.</p></note> For what purpose
the money was required we are not told. It was generally
feared that the king meditated a suppression of the<pb n="457" /><anchor id="Pg457" />
liberties of his subjects by the introduction of foreign
troops. This fear was enhanced by the knowledge that
if Charles died the crown would fall to his brother, an
uncompromising Catholic. The public mind became
so unhinged that every breath or rumour created the
greatest trepidation. Within a fortnight after the City
had signified its assent to the last loan the nation was
suddenly surprised by some words let drop by Dr.
Tonge, the weak and credulous rector of St. Michael's,
Wood Street, and the tool of the infamous Titus
Oates. A Popish plot was, he said, on foot and the
king's life in danger, in proof of which he produced
documentary evidence. Oates, the prime mover in
starting the idea of a plot, was ready in the most
shameless way with depositions to corroborate all that
Tonge had said. These depositions he made before a
Middlesex magistrate, Sir Edmondesbury Godfrey.
The next morning Godfrey's corpse was found lying
in a ditch near Primrose Hill. All London was wild
with excitement and jumped to the conclusion that
the Middlesex Justice had met a violent death for
listening to Oates's evidence, although there is reason
for believing him to have fallen by his own hands.

<p>When parliament met on the 21st of this month
it passed a new Test Act rigidly excluding all Catholics
from both Houses. Five Catholic peers were committed
to the Tower, and Coleman, the secretary of
the Duchess of York, was tried and executed for
having in his possession papers betraying a design for
forcing the Roman Catholic religion on the nation.
It next proceeded to impeach Danby for having been
concerned in certain money transactions between
Charles and the king of France. Knowing the danger
likely to arise from such an investigation, Charles
dissolved (24 Jan., 1679) the parliament, which had
now sat for more than seventeen years.</p>

<p>When the elections for the new parliament were

in the last parliament only one—Alderman Love—was
returned, the remaining seats being taken by
Alderman Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Thomas Player, the
city chamberlain, and Thomas Pilkington, afterwards
elected alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without.
This second parliament—the first of a series of short
parliaments—in Charles's reign met on the 6th March,

Just a week before parliament dissolved the Court of
Aldermen was asked (20 May) to forward an address
thanking both Houses for their care in securing the
personal safety of the king and maintaining the
Protestant religion. The address was referred back
in order to include the king in the vote of thanks, and
was then submitted (23 May) to the Common Council
for approval. That body made a further amendment
by adding the words: "The Protestant religion

<p>The elections for a fresh parliament which had

it was prorogued; and in consequence of repeated

Clayton showed himself very willing to comply

at the same time that he had reason to believe
that parliament was to meet in November. "If that
be so," said he, "I hope your great concern for that
matter might have been spared, being anticipated
by his majesties gracious intention. However, I
shall not be wanting with all humility to lay the
whole matter before him." In spite of Jeffreys, the
Recorder, having ruled that such a petition bordered
on treason, and in spite of a warning received from
the lord chancellor, Clayton insisted on presenting a
petition, and for doing so was rewarded with the
grateful thanks of the Common Council on his quitting

were nominated for form's sake, but the choice of the
citizens was unanimously in favour of the old members—Sir
Robert Clayton, Alderman Pilkington, Sir
Thomas Player, the city chamberlain, and William
Love. The election over, the Common Hall presented
an address to the members, acknowledging their past
services and promising to support them in their determination
to grant no money supply until they had
effectually secured the city against Popery and arbitrary
power. To this address Sir Robert Clayton
made a brief reply, promising, on behalf of himself

was to sit at Oxford, a stronghold of the Tory party,
caused no little alarm, and this alarm was increased

<p>Among the first against whom proceedings were

joiner by trade, who from his zeal in the cause of
religion came to be known as the "Protestant joiner."
An attempt to get a true bill returned against him at
the Old Bailey, where the juries were empanelled by<pb n="468" /><anchor id="Pg468" />
the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, having failed,
he was removed to Oxford and tried there on a charge
of high treason. After much hard swearing a verdict
was at length obtained.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, Diary, 8, 12 and 24 July and 17 Aug. (i, 108, 109,

<p>Having secured the conviction of College the
council flew at higher game in the person of the Earl
of Shaftesbury. He was arrested at his house in
Aldersgate Street on the 2nd July, but it was not
until November that a bill of high treason was preferred
against him at the Old Bailey. The nomination
of juries practically rested with the sheriffs, and the
court party had recently endeavoured to force the
election of candidates of their own political complexion.
In this they had failed, although in December last
the king had endeavoured to change the character
of city juries by ordering the mayor (Sir Patience
Ward) to issue his precept to the Aldermen to see
that none were returned by their wards for service
on juries "of inferior degree than a subsidy man."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 49, fo. 182b.</p></note>
The sheriffs for the year, Thomas Pilkington and
Samuel Shute, who were zealous Whigs, took care
to empanel a grand jury which would be inclined to
ignore the bill against the earl, and under these
circumstances the bill was thrown out (24 Nov.).<note place="foot"><p>Kennet, iii, 400.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The manner of election of sheriffs.</p></note>

<p>The failure of the court party to obtain a conviction
of Shaftesbury owing to the political bias of the sheriffs
for the time being, determined them to resort to more
drastic measures to obtain the election of candidates
with Tory proclivities. In order to understand the<pb n="469" /><anchor id="Pg469" />
method pursued it will be necessary to review briefly
the manner in which the election of sheriffs had from
time to time been carried out.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Attempt to restrict the number of electors in the 14th century.</p></note>

<p>From the earliest times of which we have any
city record until the commencement of the 14th century
it had been the custom for the sheriffs of London and
Middlesex to be elected by the mayor, aldermen and
"the good men of the city" or "commonalty."
But a custom sprang up in 1301 of summoning
twelve men only from each ward to take part with
the mayor and aldermen in such elections,<note place="foot"><p>Letter Book C, fo. 62b.</p></note> a custom
which found little favour with the bulk of the inhabitants
of the city, who insisted upon being present and taking
part in the proceedings. An attempt was made by
the civic authorities in 1313 to put a stop to the noise
and confusion resulting from the presence of such vast
numbers at the Guildhall by an order providing that
thenceforth only the best men from each ward should
be summoned to take part in the elections, and two
years later (4 July, 1315) this order was enforced by
royal proclamation.<note place="foot"><p>Letter Book D, fos. 3b, 4b.</p></note> Nevertheless the practice of
summoning representatives from the wards was soon
dropt, and for more than thirty years the sheriffs
continued to be elected by the mayor, aldermen and
the "whole commonalty." Another attempt (made
under Brembre in 1384) to restrict the number of
the commonalty to "so many and such of them as
should seem needful for the time" (<foreign lang="fr" rend="font-style: italic">tantz et tieux

was elected by the mayor and the other by the
commonalty;<note place="foot"><p>Letter Book F, fo. 142.</p></note> and this prerogative of the mayor for
the time being to elect one of the sheriffs continued
to be exercised with few (if any) exceptions down to
1638. Neither in 1639 nor in the following year
was the prerogative exercised. In 1641 the mayor
attempted to exercise it, but through some negligence
on his part was declared by the House of Commons
to have forfeited his right, and the election of both
sheriffs devolved, <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">pro hac vice</foreign>, upon the commonalty.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 39, fo. 230b.</p></note></p>

<p>From 1642 to 1651 the mayor for the time
being exercised his prerogative in electing as well as

always challenged his right to elect, although they
paid the mayor the compliment of electing his
nominee to serve with the sheriff of their own choice.
From 1652 to 1660 (or 1661<note place="foot"><p>There is no record of the election of sheriffs for this year in the
City's Archives.</p></note>?) the mayor did
not attempt to exercise a right either of electing or
nominating one of the sheriffs, but in 1662, when the
mayor would have elected as well as nominated
Thomas Bludworth as sheriff, the commonalty claimed
their rights. Bludworth was eventually returned
together with Sir William Turner.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 45, fo. 223. Pepys remarks that Bludworth and his

election of a sheriff by the mayor drinking to an individual
at a public banquet. It appears that the
lord mayor had recently drunk to William Roberts,
citizen and vintner, thereby intimating that it was
his lordship's wish that Roberts should be one
of the sheriffs for the year ensuing. The commons
objected to the mayor thus exercising his prerogative,
whilst the aldermen were no less determined to
support him.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 79, fos. 267-268, 274, 298, 309b.</p></note> The committee to whom the matter
was referred suggested a compromise, namely, that
Roberts should be bound over to take upon himself
the office if within the next two or three
years he should be either drunk to by the mayor or
elected by the commons to be sheriff; and that,
further, an Act of Common Council should be forthwith

<p>No Act of Common Council appears to have

the office.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Election of Bethell and Cornish." /><note place="margin"><p>Election of Bethell and Cornish Sheriffs, 24 June, 1680.</p></note>

<p>On Midsummer-day, 1680, the mayor elected
George Hockenhall, citizen and grocer, to be one of
the sheriffs, but Hockenhall refused to serve and was
discharged on his entering into a bond for the
payment of £400. The commons thereupon stept
in and elected Slingsby Bethell, leatherseller, and
Henry Cornish, haberdasher.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 49, fo. 111.</p></note> At this juncture
political influence was brought to bear upon the
elections. Bethell was particularly an object of
aversion to the court party. He is reported to
have declared himself ready to have acted as executioner
of the late king if no one else could be found
for the job,<note place="foot"><p>Bethell denied having said any such thing, and brought an action
for scandal against one who had spread the report.—Luttrell, Diary,

other ways. With Cornish little fault could at
present be found. Objection was raised to both
these gentlemen acting as sheriffs, on the ground
that they had not taken the oath or received the
sacrament as prescribed by law, and another election
demanded. Before this second election took place
(14 July) they had qualified themselves according to
the Corporation Act.<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, ii, 249; Luttrell, Diary, 24 June, 1680 (i, 49).</p></note> The mayor did not claim his
prerogative on this occasion. Bethell and Cornish<pb n="473" /><anchor id="Pg473" />
were put up again for office, and against them two
others, Ralph Box, grocer, and Humphrey Nicholson,
merchant taylor, who, although nominated like Bethell
and Cornish by the commonalty, were in reality candidates
put forward by the court party.<note place="foot"><p>Sir William Russell was also nominated, but did not go to the poll.</p></note> Bethell and
Cornish having been again declared elected, a poll
was demanded, which lasted several days. At its
close it was found that Cornish was at the head with
2,483 votes, Bethell next with 2,276, whilst Box
and Nicholson followed with 1,428 and 1,230 votes
respectively.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 49, fo. 112.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The character of the new Sheriffs.</p></note>

<p>The two first named were declared (29 July)
duly elected. Bethell has been described as a "sullen
and wilful man," a republican at heart and one that
"turned from the ordinary way of a sheriff's living into
the extreme of sordidness." Cornish on the other
hand was "a plain, warm, honest man and lived very
nobly all his year."<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, ii, 248.</p></note> It was doubtless Bethell's
proposal that the customary dinner to the aldermen
on the day the new sheriffs were sworn in should be
omitted. If so, Cornish had to give way to the
parsimonious whim of his fellow sheriff. "What an
obstinate man he was!" remarked Cornish of him,
when brought to trial five years later.<note place="foot"><p>Howell, State Trials, xi, 431.</p></note> The aldermen

Pilkington's election to be an invasion of the lord mayor's prerogative,
he being already in the opinion of the court duly elected and confirmed
according to ancient usage. It passed a resolution, therefore, that before
the poll was opened Alderman Pilkington should be immediately called
out on the husting and returned into the exchequer as one of the sheriffs

<p>It required some courage for the mayor to again
face the king and his chancellor and to run the risk of
another rebuff. Nevertheless, on Thursday, the 7th
July, the mayor went to Hampton Court, attended
by Sir Robert Clayton, Sir John Shorter and others,
as well as by the sheriffs Bethell and Cornish (the
new sheriffs not coming into office until September),
to present to the king in council another address from
the Common Hall. It was received with no more
favour than the last. The chancellor affected to
believe that it was but the address of a faction in the
city, and not the unanimous vote of the citizens at
large. "The king takes notice there are no aldermen,"
he said, whilst Alderman Clayton and Alderman
Shorter were at his elbow! In fine they were again

<p>Although the court party had twice signally

in having an adherent in the mayor elected on
Michaelmas-day to succeed Sir Patience Ward. The
senior alderman who had not already passed the chair
happened to be Sir John Moore. It does not often
occur that in the choice of a mayor the Common
Hall passes over the senior alderman who is both
capable and willing to take upon himself the office;
but there was some chance of it doing so in this case,
inasmuch as Sir John Moore had rendered himself
unpopular with a large section of citizens by presenting
an address of thanks to the king for the declaration

his having dissolved parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, Diary, 29 Sept. (i, 129, 130).</p></note> Two aldermen, Sir

<p>Not content with this success, the king's advisers

anomaly by which the citizens of London enjoyed
the right of electing their own sheriffs, as they
had done with short intermissions for the past 500
years, whilst in nearly every county of the kingdom
the sheriffs were nominated by the king, must be
abolished. A writ in the nature of a <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign>
was accordingly issued to the sheriffs in January,
1682, calling upon them to summon the mayor and
commonalty and citizens of the city to appear in
his majesty's court of King's Bench to answer by
what warrant they claimed divers liberties, franchises
and privileges of which the writ declared they were
impeached.<note place="foot"><p>These were (1) the right to be of themselves a body corporate

They had no cause to think that the mayor, commonalty
and citizens had usurped any liberties, franchises
or privileges without due warrant or had
abused any to which they had lawful title. One
thing was plain. It was their duty to maintain the
rights of the City. They therefore appointed a
committee to consult with counsel learned in the

Sir John Moore, having previously drunk to Dudley
North at a banquet at the Bridge House (18 May),
thereby intimating that he nominated North as one
of the sheriffs for the year ensuing, according to custom,
had issued his precept to the several companies
(19 June) to meet in Common Hall for the purpose
of <emph>confirming</emph> his nomination and electing another
sheriff to serve with his nominee.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 49, fo. 336.</p></note> This form of
precept was objected to, and when the Common Cryer
called upon the livery assembled in Common Hall to
appear for the "confirmation" of North, he was met
with cries of "No confirmation! No confirmation!"<pb n="480" /><anchor id="Pg480" />
and the rest of his proclamation was drowned in uproar.
"Thereupon," runs the City's Record,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 49, fo. 317.</p></note> "Thomas
Papillon, esq., mercer, John Du Bois, weaver, and
Ralph Box, grocer, citizens of London (together
with the said Dudley North, so as aforesaid elected
by the lord mayor), were nominated by the commonalty,
that two of them by the said commonalty
might be chosen into the office of sheriffs of the
city of London and county of Middlesex." The
Common Sergeant having declared Papillon and Du
Bois duly elected, a poll was demanded. This was
granted and proceeded with until seven o'clock in
the evening, when the meeting was adjourned by
the mayor until the 27th. The outgoing sheriffs
(Pilkington and Shute), however, disregarded the
mayor's order for adjournment and continued the
poll for some time longer, but at last adjourned the

Moore reported the conduct of Pilkington and Shute
to the king's council, with the result that before the

through indisposition, the Recorder declared his lordship's

and asked the Common Hall if it was their wish that
an adjournment should take place, and the answer
being in the negative they proceeded to finish the
poll, with the result that Papillon and Du Bois were
again declared elected by a large majority. Orders
having been given to the Town Clerk to place their
proceedings on record, the Common Hall broke up.<note place="foot"><p>The fact of a poll having been taken on the 7th July is not

<p>On the 7th the mayor and aldermen appeared in

The Hall was very crowded, and soon debate arose as
to whom belonged the right of adjournment. The

and there,<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell gives the names of Sir George Jeffreys, the late recorder,

Aldermen he declared, without hesitation, that the full right of
election was in the livery. The mode of taking the poll and of
adjournment by the sheriffs was strictly consonant to ancient usage"

"An Impartial Account of the Proceedings of the Common Hall of

sheriffs," it appears that the opinion of the recorder had been asked and
delivered to the Court of Aldermen on the 23rd June.</p></note> but with little practical result, and the

<note place="margin"><p>A fresh election ordered.</p></note>

<p>In the meanwhile several aldermen and citizens
waited on his majesty in council, and gave him an<pb n="482" /><anchor id="Pg482" />

<index index="toc" level1="Dudley North and Box." /><note place="margin"><p>The City's account of proceedings of Common Hall, 14 July, 1682.</p></note>

<p>The City's own account of what took place at the
Common Hall on the 14th is thus recorded. After the
order for a new election had been read, "relation was
... <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">de novo</foreign> made that Dudley North, esq.,
citizen and mercer of London, was elected by the
mayor by his prerogative, according to the custom,
into the office of one of the sheriffs of the city of
London and county of Middlesex for the year
ensuing, that another might be associated to him
by the commonalty. And upon this, after declaration
made that the said Dudley North was confirmed
and Thomas Papillon, esq., citizen and mercer of
London, was chosen sheriffs, certain of the commons
demanded that it might be decided by the voices of
the commons between the said Dudley North and
Thomas Papillon and John Du Bois, weaver, and
Ralph Box, grocer (named also by the commonalty),
that the two of those four who should have
the most voices might be the sheriffs elected for the
city of London and county of Middlesex for the
year ensuing. Whereupon the sheriffs and other
officers of the city in the accustomed manner went
into the upper chamber, where declaration of the
premisses was made by the common sergeant to
the mayor and aldermen there sitting; which said
mayor and aldermen, the relation aforesaid well
weighing, did declare the said Dudley North to be
rightly and duly elected and confirmed according to<pb n="483" /><anchor id="Pg483" />
the law and custom of the said city, and immediately
came down upon the place where the Court
of Hustings is usually held, and there, in their
presence and by their command, the said Dudley
North was solemnly called to come forth and give
his consent to take upon him the said office.<note place="foot"><p>.<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Cf.</foreign> Repertory 87, fo. 209b.</p></note> And
the said lord mayor did then direct that the poll
should be taken only for the said Thomas Papillon,
John Du Bois and Ralph Box, by certain persons
thereunto particularly appointed by the said lord
mayor, that one of those three who had the most
voices might be associated to the said Dudley North.
And afterwards the said mayor and aldermen
departed out of the hall. And the poll for the
said three persons last named was immediately
begun, and continued until the evening of that day.
And then the said congregation was, by order of the
lord mayor, adjourned until the next day, being
Saturday, the 15th of July aforesaid, at 9 o'clock in
the afternoon [<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">sic.</foreign>]. At which day the said poll
being continued was in the afternoon of that day
finished. And thereupon relation was made by the
common sergeant to the mayor and aldermen that
upon the poll taken by the severall persons appointed
by the said lord mayor as aforesaid, there
were 60 voices for Mr. Papillon, 60 voices for Mr.
Du Bois, and 1,244 voices for Mr. Box. By which
it appeared that the said Ralph Box had the most
voices, and so was elected into the office of one of
the sheriffs of the city of London and county of
Middlesex for the year ensuing. And the same in
the afternoon was so declared by the common<pb n="484" /><anchor id="Pg484" />
sergeant to the commons then and there assembled,
which said election of the said Ralph Box was by
the aforesaid mayor, aldermen and commonalty
ratified and confirmed. And thereupon, according
to the form and effect of the Act of Common Council
in that case made and provided, publication
thereof by proclamation being then made in the
place where the Hustings Court is usually held in
the presence of the said lord mayor, aldermen and
sheriffs, the said Ralph Box was then and there
solemnly called, etc."</p>

<p>Very different is the account of the proceedings
as given us in a tract of the day.<note place="foot"><p>"The Domestick Intelligence" (Tracts A* No. 18).—Luttrell
Diary, 15 July, 1682 (i, 206).</p></note> From the latter
we learn that a separate poll was opened the same
day by the sheriffs, in which all four candidates
were submitted to the choice of the citizens, and
the result of which was declared by Sheriff Pilkington
on the 15th, prior to the mayor's declaration.
According to this poll, Papillon and Du Bois were
again returned at the head with 2,487 and 2,481
votes respectively. There were only 107 in favour
of confirming North's election, whilst 2,414 gave
their votes against it. Box found himself with
only 173 supporters. It was after the declaration of
this result that the mayor ordered the common
sergeant to declare the result of the other poll, but
the declaration of the large number of votes alleged
to have been given in favour of Box caused so much
uproar that he could proceed no further. The mayor
and aldermen thereupon left the hall, and Papillon and
Du Bois were declared by the sheriffs duly elected.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Petitions for Papillon and Du Bois to be called upon to take office, July, 1682.</p></note>

<p>It was expected that Box would attend before
the next Court of Aldermen to be held on the 18th
July to give bond for holding office as North had
already done, but he failed to appear. A petition,
therefore, was presented to the court praying that
as Papillon and Du Bois had been elected sheriffs the
court should call them forth according to custom.
The mayor being advised to postpone giving an
answer, another petition to the same effect was presented
at the next court (20 July), whilst yet a third
prayed that a <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">caveat</foreign> might be entered against North
and Box being admitted and sworn sheriffs. The
mayor was again advised to take time to consider his
answer.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 27, fos. 212, 214.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The mayor's unsatisfactory reply, 27 July.</p></note>

<p>A week later (27 July) the mayor made the
following reply to the petitioners, by advice of the
court:—"Gentlemen, this court hath considered of
your petition, and will take care that such persons
shall take the office of sheriffs upon them as are duly
elected according to law and the ancient customs
of this city; and in this and all other things this
court will endeavour to maintain the rights and
privileges of the chair and of the whole city; and
wherein you think that we do otherwise the law
must judge between us."<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 87, fos. 216b.</p></note> This was little to the
liking of the petitioners, who complained that it was
no answer to their petition; but they were summarily
dismissed.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, Diary, 27 July, 1682 (i, 209, 210).</p></note></p>

<p>Thus the matter was allowed to rest until the
5th September, when the Court of Aldermen were<pb n="486" /><anchor id="Pg486" />
again prayed that Papillon and Du Bois might be
called upon to enter into bond according to custom.
The only answer returned was that Box, who in the
opinion of the court had been duly elected one of the
sheriffs, had been discharged from service on payment
of a fine, and that another election would shortly
take place. Thereupon murmurs arose. There had
been too many Common Halls already over this
affair, cried some, and their choice of sheriffs had been
made. The mayor bade them begone in the king's
name, or they would be looked upon as tumultuous.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 87, fos. 221b, 222; Luttrell, Diary, 5 Sept. (i, 217).</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>More petitions to the Court of Aldermen, 12, 14 Sept.</p></note>

<p>The court sat again on the 12th September, when,
we are told, a petition similar to those before presented
being again brought forward, a debate arose which
occasioned some sharp words, and the mayor ordered
the sword to be taken up and so dissolved the court;
but nothing of this is recorded in the minutes of the
court.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, Diary, 12 Sept., 1682 (i, 218, 219).</p></note> Two days later (14 Sept.), several petitions
were presented to the court, one being from the free-holders
of Middlesex.<note place="foot"><p>A printed copy will be found, Tracts preserved in the Guildhall
Library (A* No. 28).</p></note> To these the same reply was
made as had been given to the petitioners of the 27th
July. The petitioners were further told that it was
the mayor's intention to call a Common Hall on
Tuesday, the 19th September, to elect one to serve
in the place of Box.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 87, fos. 230b-231.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Peter Rich a candidate <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">loco</foreign> Box.</p></note>

<p>When that day arrived and the common sergeant,
acting on instructions from the mayor, put forward the
name of Peter Rich, there arose repeatedly the cry of<pb n="487" /><anchor id="Pg487" />
"No Rich!" and such a din followed, the citizens declaring
loudly that they would stand by their old choice,
that nothing else could be heard. At length the sheriffs
were given to understand that a poll was demanded.
The mayor hearing of the proposed poll thereupon
came on to the hustings and declared Rich to be duly
elected. The whole business was carried on in dumb
show, it being impossible to hear anything that was said.
Having done this, the mayor dissolved the Common
Hall and went home. The sheriff proceeded nevertheless
to open the poll in the afternoon, with the result
that 2,082 votes were found in favour of standing by
their old choice, whilst only thirty-five were for
Rich. Hearing that the mayor was returning, the
sheriffs made a hurried declaration of the result of
the poll, proclaiming Papillon and Du Bois to have
been again elected, and dismissed the assembly.
The mayor on his arrival caused the gates of the
Guildhall to be closed. Such is the account of
what took place on the 19th September, as given
by the diarist of the day.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, Diary, i, 220, 221.</p></note> The City's Journal merely

<p>The next day (20 Sept.) the lord mayor and a
deputation of aldermen waited on the king at Whitehall,
and informed him of what had taken place. A
council was thereupon summoned for that afternoon,
which the sheriffs were ordered to attend. Upon their
appearance they were told that they had behaved in
a riotous manner, and must answer for their conduct
before the King's Bench.  They were accordingly<pb n="488" /><anchor id="Pg488" />
made to enter into their own recognisances severally
for £1,000, besides finding other security.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 221.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Rich enters into bond to take office, 26 Sept., 1682.</p></note>

<p>On the 26th, when Rich was called before the
Court of Aldermen to enter into bond to take office,
a paper was handed to the court desiring that Papillon
and Du Bois might be called to the shrievalty, but
it was to no purpose. The same answer was returned
as on previous occasions.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 87, fo. 233.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>North and Rich sworn into office, 28 Sept.</p></note>

<p>Two days later (28 Sept.) Rich and North were
sworn into office amid a great concourse of citizens
at the Guildhall, the entrance to which was strongly
guarded by a company of trained bands in case of
disturbance. When the oath was about to be administered
to them a protest was made by Papillon and
Du Bois, who attempted to get possession of the
book; but upon the lord mayor commanding them
in the king's name to depart and keep the peace,
they left the hall and with them went several of
the aldermen who were their supporters. The new
sheriffs entertained the mayor and aldermen, according
to custom, at Grocers' Hall, Rich being a member of
that company.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, Diary, 28 Sept., 1682 (i, 224).</p></note> Rich subsequently applied for and was
allowed the sum of £100 out of the fine of £400 paid
into the Chamber by Box.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 87, fo. 253.</p></note> The election which had
been so long and so hotly contested thus ended in a
complete victory for the court party.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Mercers' Company and Sheriff North.</p></note>

<p>It was the custom in those days, as it is now, for
members of the livery company or companies to
which a newly-elected sheriff belonged to accompany<pb n="489" /><anchor id="Pg489" />
him to the Guildhall on the occasion of his entering
upon his office. Dudley North, being a member of
the Mercers' Company, had desired the officers of the
company and several of the livery to pay him this
compliment, but after considering the matter the
court of the company passed a resolution to the
effect that neither officers nor members should attend
him on pain of being expelled from the company, but
that they should accompany Papillon to the hall and
present him to be sworn as one of the sheriffs.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 223.</p></note></p>

<p>Cornish attended the ceremony at the Guildhall,

Sir William Turner,<note place="foot"><p>Information (dated 2 Oct.) preserved in the Town Clerk's office.</p></note> a brother alderman, of the
treatment he had received at the hands of the
soldiers present. The information was to the effect
that when he and several other aldermen entered the
hall about nine o'clock in the morning they found a
guard of soldiers placed at the hall door, and another
drawn up before the hustings, "who were presently
commanded by their officer to stand to their armes."
After a short stay in the Council Chamber they
returned into the hall to meet the lord mayor, and
for a quarter of an hour walked up and down the hall
"betweene the clock-house and the doore w<hi rend="vertical-align: super">ch</hi> leads
up to the Hustings Court on the north side of
the hall." Hitherto they had met with no opposition
from the soldiers, but now they were accosted
by Lieutenant-Colonel Quiney, the officer in command,
who desired "they would give him noe
disturbance." To this they replied that "they would<pb n="490" /><anchor id="Pg490" />
give him none and expected alsoe not to bee themselves
disturbed by anie in that place." Quiney
thereupon left, but soon after returned and told them
he had orders from the lieutenancy to clear the hall.
He was asked to produce the order, and if it were
found to include aldermen of the city Cornish and
his friends would obey. The order was not forthcoming;
it was with the major, said Quiney, who
soon afterwards formed up his men and, again
addressing Cornish and the other aldermen, peremptorily
required them to withdraw or he would expel
them by force. Cornish again demanded to see the
order, but the officer forthwith laid hands on him
and thrust him out, declaring that he would abide by
the order of the lieutenancy, who were his masters.
So ends Cornish's information. Proceedings were
subsequently taken against Quiney for keeping persons
that were liverymen out of the Guildhall and
offering abuse to others.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 225.</p></note></p>

<p>This result seems to have satisfied no one, and a
scrutiny was asked for in order that the poll books
might be compared with the lists of liverymen of
the several companies. It was discovered that certain
members of the livery of the Merchant Taylors' and
other companies had recorded their votes although
they had not taken the liveryman's oath prescribed
by such companies. The question of the legality of
such votes being submitted to the Court of Aldermen,
that body decided (24 Oct.) against the voters.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 87, fo. 258.</p></note> The
election was watched with anxious interest. Pritchard,
himself a Merchant Taylor, was known to be of the
same political mind as the out-going mayor, and it
was the common belief at the time that if the
majority of votes should prove to be in favour of
Gold or Cornish, who were of the Whig party, the
king would interpose and continue Sir John Moore in
office for another year.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, Diary, 4 Oct., 1682 (i, 226).</p></note> His majesty had recently

presented to the Court of Aldermen for them to

<p>The time was thought opportune by the Duke of
York for prosecuting his action for slander against
Pilkington commenced in June last. The words
complained of, and for which the duke claimed
damages to the extent of £50,000, were declared on
the oath of two aldermen—Sir Henry Tulse and Sir
William Hooker—to have been spoken by him at a
Court of Aldermen at a time when that body was
about to visit the duke to congratulate him upon his
return from Scotland, and were to the effect that the
duke had burnt the city and was then coming to cut
their throats. That the words, if spoken—a question
open to much doubt—were scandalous to a degree
cannot be denied, but the claim for damages was none
the less vindictive. Instead of laying his action in
London the duke caused his action to be tried by a
jury of the county of Hertford (24 Nov.). Pilkington
made very little defence (he probably thought it
useless), and the jury awarded the duke the full<pb n="493" /><anchor id="Pg493" />
amount of damages claimed. The ex-sheriff was of
course ruined; he surrendered himself into custody<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 192, 240, 241.</p></note>

with Lord Grey of Wark, Alderman Cornish, Sir
Thomas Player, the city chamberlain (who had
recently been called to account for moneys received),
Slingsby Bethell, and others were brought to trial
for the disturbance that had taken place last Midsummer-day.
The trial was opened at the Guildhall
on the 16th February, but the jury being challenged
on the ground that the array contained no peer
(a peer of the realm being about to be tried), the
challenge was allowed, and the trial put off until
the next term. On the 8th May, after a long trial,
all the accused were found guilty, and were eventually
(26 June) fined in various sums, amounting in all to
£4,100.<note place="foot"><p>Howell, State Trials, ix, 187-294; Luttrell, Diary, i, 250, 257,

at the coming feast of St. Thomas (21 Dec.) the
obligation of electing only such men to be members
of the new council as had conformed with the provisions
of the Corporation Act. The king's letter
was by the mayor's precept read at each wardmote

<index index="toc" level1="Proceedings on the Quo Warranto." /><note place="margin"><p>The first hearing of the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign> case, 7 Feb., 1683.</p></note>

<p>The design failed and the king resolved at length
to proceed with the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign>. After the lapse
of more than a twelvemonth the trial came on for
hearing (7 Feb., 1683). The solicitor-general, who
opened the case, propounded to the court four
questions: (1) Whether any corporation could be
forfeited? (2) Whether the city of London differed
from other corporations as to point of forfeiture?
(3) Whether any act of the mayor, aldermen and<pb n="495" /><anchor id="Pg495" />
Common Council in Common Council assembled be
so much the act of the Corporation as could make a
forfeiture? and (4) Whether the acts by them done
in making a certain by-law and receiving money
by it,<note place="foot"><p>Referring to the taking of market tolls.</p></note> or in making the petition of the 13th January,
1681, and causing it to be published, be such acts as,
if done by the Corporation, would make a forfeiture of
the Corporation? After a lengthy argument counsel
for the Crown concluded by asking judgment for the
king, and that the defendants might be ousted of their
franchise as a Corporation.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The speech of the City's Recorder.</p></note>

<p>The City's Recorder, Sir George Treby, rose in
reply. His argument in favour of the City<note place="foot"><p>Set out in full in Journal 50, fos. 40b-60b.</p></note> tended to
show that the corporation of London <foreign rend="font-style: italic">quâ</foreign> corporation
could not forfeit its existence either by voluntary
surrender or by abuse of its powers, much less could
its existence be imperilled by the action of those
representatives of the city to whom its government
had been confided. The corporation of the City was
a governing body elected for specific purposes; if it
proceeded <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">ultra vires</foreign> to establish market tolls or to
offer a petition to the king which was seditious, an
indictment lay against every particular member of
that body, but no execution could be taken against
the mayor, commonalty and citizens of London, a
body politic that is invisible, one that can neither see
nor be seen.</p>

<p>Counsel on the other side had laid stress on the fact
that the liberties and franchises of the City had been
often seized or "taken into the king's hands," adducing
instances with which the reader of the earlier<pb n="496" /><anchor id="Pg496" />
pages of this work will be already familiar; and if
they could be so seized, they could also be forfeited.
The Recorder argued that this conclusion was a wrong
one. The effect of the seizure of the City's liberties
in former days had only been to place the government
of the city in the hands of a <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">custos</foreign> or warden. The
Corporation continued as before; it might sue and be
sued as before; it was neither suspended nor destroyed.
How could the king seize a Corporation?
Could he himself constitute the mayor, commonalty
and citizens of a city, or make anyone else such?
No, a Corporation was not, to use a legal phrase,
"manurable"; it could not be seized; nor had anyone
(he believed) ever imagined such a thing as a
dissolution of a corporation by a judgment in law
until that day. At the conclusion of his speech the
further hearing of the case was adjourned until April.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Speech of the attorney-general at the second hearing, 27 April.</p></note>

<p>On the resumption of the hearing (27 April)<note place="foot"><p>This is the date given by Howell (State Trials, viii, p. 1147),
but according to Luttrell, the second hearing took place on the
30th April and the 1st May.</p></note>
Sir Robert Sawyer, the attorney-general, at whose
suggestion and by whose authority the writ against
the City had been issued, took up the argument, commencing
his speech with an attempt to allay the apprehension
excited by the prospect of forfeiture of the
City's charter. "It was not the king's intention," he
said, "to demolish at once all their liberties and to
lay waste and open the city of London, and to
reduce it to the condition of a country village," as
some had maliciously reported, but to amend the
government of the City "by running off those
excesses and exorbitances of power which some<pb n="497" /><anchor id="Pg497" />
men (contrary to their duty and the known laws of
the land) have assumed to themselves under colour
of their corporate capacity, to the reviling of their
prince, the oppression of their fellow subjects and
to the infinite disquiet of their fellow citizens."<note place="foot"><p>Howell, State Trials, viii, pp. 1147, 1148.</p></note>
History had shown that the City had never been
better governed than when it was in the king's hands.
Its ancient customs had not been destroyed, but
only restrained in subordination to the general government
of the kingdom, and therefore the danger now
threatened would not prove so fatal to the City as had
been suggested.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Judgment pronounced." /><note place="margin"><p>Judgment pronounced against the City, 12 June, 1683.</p></note>

<p>After the conclusion of the arguments on both
sides, nearly three months were allowed to pass before
judgment was given, in the hope that the citizens of
London might follow the example set by Norwich,
Evesham and other boroughs, and freely surrender
their charter. "I do believe nobody here wishes
this case should come to judgment," was the remark
made by Chief Justice Saunders at the conclusion of
the hearing; but at length the patience of the Crown
or of the judges was exhausted, and judgment was
pronounced (12 June) by Justice Jones in the absence
of the Lord Chief Justice, who was now on the point
of death. Briefly, the judgment pronounced was to
the effect (1) that a corporation aggregate might be
seized; (2) that exacting and taking money by a
"pretended" by-law was extortion and a forfeiture
of franchise; (3) that the petition was scandalous and
libellous, and the making and publishing it a forfeiture;
(4) that an Act of Common Council is an Act of<pb n="498" /><anchor id="Pg498" />
the Corporation; (5) that the matter set forth in the
record did not excuse or avoid those forfeitures set
forth in the replication, and (6) that the information
was well founded. The result of these findings was
that the franchise of the Corporation was ordered to
be seized into the king's hands, but this judgment was
not to be entered until the king's pleasure should be
known. As to the right claimed by the citizens to
have and constitute sheriffs (a right which they had
recently shown no disposition to forego) and the claim
of the mayor and aldermen to be Justices of the
Peace and to hold Sessions, the attorney-general
was content to enter a <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">nolle prosequi</foreign>.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Minutes of the Common Council reflecting on the late king ordered to be expunged from the Journals, 6 June, 1683.</p></note>

The list of the various minutes thus ordered to be

of eighteen years (1641-1659). The municipal authorities
may have thought that by this egregious act
of self-stultification they might mitigate the judgment
that was impending over them. If so they were
sadly mistaken.</p>

18th June, the lord mayor proceeded to Windsor,
accompanied by a deputation of aldermen and
members of the Common Council, to lay this petition
before the king in council, and his majesty's reply,
given by the mouth of the lord keeper, was reported
to the Common Council on the following Wednesday.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 82. A copy of the petition and the lord keeper's

<note place="margin"><p>Speech of the lord keeper.</p></note>

<p>The king, he said, had been very loth to take
action against the City, but had been driven to do so
by the recent elections. Their petition would
have been more gracious if presented earlier; nevertheless,
his majesty would not reject it on that
account. He would, however, show the City as
much favour as could be reasonably expected. It
was not his intention to prejudice them either in
their properties or customs, and he had instructed
Mr. Attorney not to enter judgment lest such a
proceeding might entail serious consequences. The
alterations he required were few and easy. They
were these, viz., that no mayor, sheriff, recorder,
common sergeant, town clerk or coroner of the city
of London or any steward of the borough of Southwark
should be appointed without his majesty's approval
under his sign manual; that if his majesty should
express disapproval of the choice of a mayor made by
the citizens a new election should take place within
a week, and if his majesty should disapprove of the
second choice he shall, if he so please, himself
nominate a mayor for the year ensuing; that if his
majesty should in like manner disapprove of the<pb n="500" /><anchor id="Pg500" />
persons chosen to be sheriffs, or either of them, he
shall, if he please, proceed to appoint sheriffs by his
commission, but subject to this restriction the election
of these officers might take according to the ancient
usuage of the city; that the lord mayor and Court of
Aldermen might with leave of his majesty displace
any alderman, recorder, common sergeant, town
clerk, coroner of the city or steward of Southwark;
that where an election of an alderman had been set
aside by the Court of Aldermen another election
should be held, and that the Justices of the Peace
should be by his majesty's commission. These
terms accepted by the citizens, his majesty would
consent to confirm their charter in a manner consistent
with them. But if they were not speedily
complied with his majesty had given orders to
enter up judgment by the Saturday following, and
any consequences that might follow would be at the
door of the citizens themselves.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Terms offered the City." /><note place="margin"><p>The City accept the king's terms, 20 June, 1683.</p></note>

<p>A "long and serious" debate, we are told,
followed the reading of this answer in the Common
Council, after which a poll was taken on the question:
whether the court should submit to the king's terms
or not, with the result that 104 votes were recorded
in favour of accepting them as against 85 votes
to the contrary. Whereupon it was "unanimously"
ordered that his majesty should be informed of the
court's submission, and that the Midsummer-day

this done than one of the city sergeants proceeded
to arrest the coroner, who was taken to the compter,
where he had to pass the night, whilst the mayor and
his fellow-prisoners made their way home. A cry
that the Whigs had seized the mayor and carried him
off caused great consternation, and the trained bands
were immediately ordered out for the security of the
city. The citizens themselves were much divided in
their opinions on the matter, "some condemning it

was suspected of being implicated in the conspiracy,

<index index="toc" level1="Surrender or No Surrender?" /><note place="margin"><p>The question of surrender or no surrender of the City's franchise, Sept.-Oct., 1683.</p></note>

<p>On Thursday, the 27th September, the mayor
laid before the Common Council drafts of a surrender
of the City's franchise to his majesty, and of a re-grant
from his majesty which the Attorney-general had
prepared for their acceptance. After long debate the
opinion of the Attorney-general, the Solicitor-general,
and the Recorder was taken upon the following
questions, viz., (1) Whether the surrender was agreeable
to the submission of the Common Council
already made and necessary for the regulations
required by his majesty; (2) whether by this surrender
the office of mayoralty was surrendered; (3) if
so, whether the customs and prescriptions belonging
to that office were not thereby surrendered and lost;
(4) whether in case judgment should be entered up
(as the king had threatened) the consequences would
not be worse than a surrender; and (5) how far did the
re-grant confirm and restore the city to the liberties,
etc., therein mentioned. On the following Tuesday<pb n="504" /><anchor id="Pg504" />
(2 Oct.) the opinions of the several counsel were
ready.<note place="foot"><p>The opinions are fully set out in Journal 50, fos. 96-100b.</p></note> Two of them, viz., that of the Attorney-general
and that of the Solicitor-general were decidedly
in favour of the City surrendering its liberties in preference
to allowing judgment to be entered up. The
Recorder took a diametrically opposite view of the
matter, one of the reasons urged by him against a
surrender being that such action would be against
their oaths, and that if they freely surrendered their
liberties there would be no redress left open to them.
If, on the other hand, they suffered judgment to be
entered up, they could take proceedings against it by
writ of error. These opinions gave rise to much
debate, and many hard things were spoken against the
Recorder. At last the matter was put to the vote,
when 103 were found against sealing the deed of
surrender as against 85 who were in favour of it; and
so this momentous question was settled, and the
council broke up at eleven o'clock at night.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 98; Luttrell, Diary, 2 Oct.</p></note></p>

could, surrendering their former charters and receiving
new charters in their place. The first master, wardens

<p>"They will never kill me, James, to make you
king," the late king is said to have cynically remarked
to his brother; and, indeed, the accession of the
Duke of York was accepted by the nation in general,
as well as by the City of London in particular, with
considerable foreboding. The new king for a short
while was content to feel his way before plunging
into the headstrong course of action which eventually
lost him the crown. Although suspected of being a
Catholic at heart, it was only during his last moments
that Charles had accepted the ministrations of the
Roman Church. The new king had for years been an
avowed Catholic; nevertheless, in his first speech to
the Privy Council he announced his intention of
maintaining the established government, both in
Church and State. This speech, made within an hour
of the late king's death, was received with rapturous
applause. It was quickly followed by a proclamation
of his majesty's wish that all persons in office at the
time of the decease of the late king should so continue
until further notice.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 128.</p></note> Another document proclaiming
the death of the late king and the devolution of the
crown to the Duke of York was at the same time
drawn up by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, with
the assistance of the privy council, the mayor,
aldermen and citizens of London and others.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 129b.</p></note> This<pb n="507" /><anchor id="Pg507" />
document did not bear the signature of the mayor as

<index index="toc" level1="The question of Supply." /><note place="margin"><p>The question of continuation of customs and excise.</p></note>

<p>James had not been many days on the throne
before the question of supply had to be settled.
More than one-half of the whole revenue of the
crown was derived from the customs, and these had
been settled on Charles for life only, and could not
therefore be exacted by his successor without the
assent of parliament. No parliament had been
summoned since the dissolution of the parliament at
Oxford four years since (28 March, 1681). As time
was pressing and some delay must have taken place
before a new parliament could meet, James took the
advice of Chief Justice Jeffreys, and did violence to
the constitution by proclaiming (9 Feb.) the continuation
of the payment of customs as a matter of
necessity, whilst at the same time he intimated his
intention of speedily calling a parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 129.</p></note> The pill
thus gilded was swallowed without protest. The
excise duties was another matter and was dealt
with differently. The "additional excise," like the
customs, had been given to the late king for life, but
there was a clause in the Act which empowered
the Lords of the Treasury to let them to farm for a
term of three years without any limitation as to their
being so long due. A lease was now propounded as
having been made during the late king's life (the
document bearing date the 5th February, the day
preceding his decease), although there was every
reason for supposing it to have been made after his
death and to have been post-dated. The judges were<pb n="508" /><anchor id="Pg508" />
appealed to, and with every desire to curry favour
with the new king, the majority pronounced the
document to be good in law. Thus fortified, James
no longer hesitated to issue a proclamation (16 Feb.)
for the continuation of the excise.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 130; Burnet, iii, 10; Luttrell, i, 330.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The coronation of king and queen, 23 April, 1685.</p></note>

<p>A parliament was summoned for the 9th April,

the king and queen had been crowned at
Westminster on St. George's day (23 April). The
City put in their customary claim,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 131; Repertory 90, fo. 61.</p></note> but this was at
first disallowed "in regard of the judgment upon the
<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign> for seizure of the cities franchise."
Upon appeal being made, however, to the king himself
the claim was allowed, and the mayor, aldermen
and citizens were treated with high honour both in
the Abbey and at the banquet in Westminster Hall,
the mayor being presented by the king with the cup
of pure gold and cover, weighing in all upwards of
twenty ounces, with which he had served his majesty
with wine.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 90, fo. 72b, 78b-79.</p></note> A few days before the banquet took
place Sir Robert Vyner sent to the mayor to borrow
the City's plate for the occasion. The matter was
laid before the Court of Aldermen and permission

<p>When parliament met (19 May) the majority in
favour of the court party was enormous. This was in
no small measure due to the reformation that had
been forced on other corporate towns besides the city
of London. They had been made to surrender their<pb n="509" /><anchor id="Pg509" />
charters, and the late king had in return granted
them new charters in which Tories alone were named
as members of the corporations. Only one more
step was necessary in order to secure the return of a
Tory parliament when the time for fresh elections
should arrive, and that step was taken. The parliamentary
franchise in boroughs was restricted to
members of the corporations.<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, iii, 16. "There have been quo warranto'es brought
against divers corporations ... with what design is easily
apparent."—Luttrell, Diary, Feb., 1684 (i, 302).</p></note> In London the Whigs
were kept down by fear, and the Tory party reigned
supreme. The mayor and half the Court of Aldermen
were nominees of the Crown, acting by royal commission.
No Common Council sat, or if it did it
was only for the purpose of enrolling a proclamation
by the king or a precept by the mayor. As the
election drew near the king, in order to render the
result in his favour more sure, authorized the Court
of Aldermen to grant liveries to several of the city
companies, taking care that such only should be
admitted to the livery as were of "unquestionable
loyalty" for the purpose of voting.<note place="foot"><p>Mayor's precept, 5 May, 1685.—Journal 50, fo. 134.</p></note> By this means
four of the most pronounced Tories in the city
were returned, all of them being aldermen. These
were Sir John Moore and Sir William Pritchard,
both of whom had been placed in the mayoralty
chair, one after the other (in 1681 and 1682), by
court influence, Sir Peter Rich, who had served as
sheriff with Dudley North in 1682, and Sir Samuel
Dashwood, who filled the same office the following
year with Peter Daniel, both of them, like their
immediate predecessors, being nominees of the Crown.<pb n="510" /><anchor id="Pg510" />

<index index="toc" level1="Oates and Dangerfield." /><note place="margin"><p>Oates and Dangerfield whipt at the cart's tail, May, 1685.</p></note>

<p>The bent of the king's mind was quickly discerned
in the sentences pronounced by judges eager
to secure his favour. Titus Oates was taken out of
prison and whipt at the cart's tail from Aldgate to
Newgate the day after parliament met. Two days
later he was again whipt from Newgate to Tyburn,
and the punishment was so mercilessly carried out
that it nearly cost him his life. Precautions had to
be taken by the mayor to prevent a display of force
by Oates's partisans, who overturned the pillory on
which he was to stand.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 135b.</p></note> Dangerfield, another professional
informer, was made to undergo a punishment
scarcely less severe. He survived the punishment,
but only to die from the effect of a vicious blow dealt
him by a bystander as he was being carried back to
gaol from Tyburn.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Richard Baxter." /><note place="margin"><p>Richard Baxter brought to trial, 30 May, 1685.</p></note>

<p>On the other hand Richard Baxter—the most
learned and moderate of Nonconformists—was tried
at the Guildhall on a charge of having introduced into
his commentary on the New Testament some seditious
remarks respecting the attitude of the government
towards dissenters. The infamous Jeffreys presided
at the trial, and spared neither counsel nor prisoner
his insolent invectives. The whole proceedings were
nothing less than a farce, and the evidence adduced
was of such a flimsy character that Baxter volunteered
a remark expressing a doubt whether any jury would
convict a man on it. He was, however, mistaken.<pb n="511" /><anchor id="Pg511" />
The sheriffs, like the mayor, were but tools of the
court party, and the jurymen selected to sit on the
trial did not hesitate to bring in a verdict of guilty. He
was fortunate to get off with no worse sentence than a
fine of 500 marks and imprisonment until it was paid.<note place="foot"><p>Kennet, iii, 446, 447.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Monmouth Rebellion." /><note place="margin"><p>The Monmouth Rebellion, 1685.</p></note>

<p>There was doubtless a large number of inhabitants
of the city who would gladly have assisted
Monmouth—"the champion of the dissenters and
extreme Protestants"—had they been in a position
to do so. But as soon as the news of the duke's
landing in Dorsetshire reached London orders were
issued by the mayor for a strict watch to be kept by
night throughout the city, and for the arrest of all
suspicious characters, whilst the duke and his supporters
were proclaimed traitors and rebels. It was
forbidden to circulate the duke's manifesto in the
city, and on the 16th June, or within five days of his
landing, a price of £5,000 was put upon his head.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fos. 136-137b.</p></note>
After Monmouth's defeat at Sedgmoor (6 July) he
and his companions sought safety in flight. Monmouth
himself fled to the New Forest, where he was
captured in the last stage of poverty, sleeping in
a ditch, and was brought to London. He was lodged
in the Tower, where his wife and three children had
already been sent. Thousands of spectators, who,
we are told, "seemed much troubled," went forth to
witness his arrival by water on the evening of the
13th July. Two days later he was executed on
Tower Hill.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Trial and execution of Cornish." /><note place="margin"><p>Trial of Cornish and others, 19 Oct., 1685. </p></note>

<p>The utmost cruelty, both military and judicial,
was inflicted on Monmouth's supporters. Many were<pb n="512" /><anchor id="Pg512" />
hanged by royalist soldiers—"Kirke's lambs," as
they were called—without form of law. Others
were committed for trial until Jeffreys came to hold
his "Bloody Assize," when to the cruelty of the
sentences passed on most of them was added the
ribald insolence of the judge. The opportunity was
taken of giving the city of London a lesson, and
Henry Cornish, late alderman and sheriff, was
suddenly arrested. This took place on Tuesday the
13th October. He was kept a close prisoner, not
allowed to see friends or counsel, and deprived of
writing materials. On Saturday he was informed for
the first time that he would be tried on a charge of
high treason, and that the trial would commence on
the following Monday (19 Oct.). His attitude before
the judges was calm and dignified. Before pleading
not guilty to the charge of having consented to aid
and abet the late Duke of Monmouth and others in
their attempt on the life of the late king (the Rye
House Plot), he entered a protest against the indecent
haste with which he had been called upon to
plead and the short time allowed him to prepare his
case. He asked for further time, but this the judges
refused.</p>

<p>One of the chief witnesses for the Crown was
Goodenough, who had a personal spite against
Cornish for his having objected to him (Goodenough)
serving as under-sheriff in 1680-1, the year when
Bethell and Cornish were sheriffs.<note place="foot"><p>Goodenough had been nominated under-sheriff by Bethell against
the wish of Cornish, and much discussion had arisen between the two
sheriffs in consequence.</p></note> Goodenough
had risked his neck in Monmouth's late rebellion, but<pb n="513" /><anchor id="Pg513" />
he had succeeded in obtaining a pardon by promises
of valuable information against others. With the
king's pardon in his pocket he unblushingly declared
before the judges that he, as well as Cornish and
some others, had determined upon a general rising in
the city at the time of the Rye House Plot. "We
designed," said he, "to divide it (<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">i.e.</foreign>, the city) into
twenty parts, and out of each part to raise five
hundred men, if it might be done, to make an insurrection."<note place="foot"><p>Howell, State Trials, xi, 426.</p></note>
The Tower was to be seized and the
guard expelled.</p>

<p>Cornish had been afforded no opportunity for
instructing counsel in his defence. He was therefore
obliged to act as his own counsel, with the result
usual in such cases. He rested his main defence upon
the improbability of his having acted as the prosecution
endeavoured to make out. This he so persistently
urged that the judges lost patience. Improbability was
not enough, they declared; let him call his witnesses.
When, however, Cornish desired an adjournment in
order that he might bring a witness up from Lancashire,
his request was refused. His chief witness he omitted
to call until after the lord chief justice had summed up.
This man was a vintner of the city, named Shephard, at
whose house Cornish was charged with having met and
held consultation with Monmouth and the rest of the
conspirators. The bench after some demur assented
to the prisoner's earnest prayer that Shephard's evidence
might be taken. He showed that he had been
in the habit of having commercial transactions with
Cornish and was at that moment in his debt; that on
the occasion in question Cornish had come to his<pb n="514" /><anchor id="Pg514" />
house, but whether he came to speak with the Duke
of Monmouth or not the witness could not say for
certain; that he only remained a few minutes, and
that no paper or declaration (on which so much stress
had been laid) in connection with the conspiracy was
read in Cornish's presence; that in fact Cornish was
not considered at the time as being in the plot. Such
evidence, if not conclusive, ought to have gone far
towards obtaining a verdict of acquittal for the prisoner.
This was not the case, however; the witness was
characterised by one of the judges as "very forward,"
and when Cornish humbly remonstrated with the
treatment his witness was receiving from the bench he
was sharply told to hold his tongue. The jury after
a brief consultation brought in a verdict of guilty,
and Cornish had to submit to the indignity of being
tied—like a dangerous criminal—whilst sentence of
death was passed upon him and three others who
had been tried at the same time.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Execution of Cornish, 23 Oct., 1685.</p></note>

<p>The prisoner was allowed but three clear days
before he was hanged at the corner of King Street
and Cheapside, within sight of the Guildhall which
he had so often frequented as an alderman of the
city, and on which his head was afterwards placed.
He met his end with courage and with many pious
expressions, but to the last maintained his innocence
with such vehemence that his enemies gave out that
he had "died in a fit of fury."<note place="foot"><p>Howell, State Trials, xi, 450, 451; Burnet, iii, 65, 66.</p></note> The injustice of his

<p>Of the three others who had been tried with
Cornish, two were reprieved (one was afterwards
executed), but the third, Elizabeth Gaunt, was burnt
at Tyburn the same day that Cornish suffered (23 Oct.)
for having harboured an outlaw named Burton and
assisted him to escape beyond the law. He had been
implicated in the Rye House Plot, but with the aid
of Mrs. Gaunt, who lived in the city, had contrived to
avoid capture. In order to save his own skin the
wretch did not hesitate to turn king's evidence and
to sacrifice the life of his benefactress, a woman who
is described as having "spent a great part of her life
in acts of charity, visiting the gaols and looking
after the poor." She too died with great fortitude,
arranging with her own hands the straw around her,
so as to burn the more speedily.<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, iii, 62.</p></note></p>

<p>Parliament began to be alarmed at the favour
shown to Catholics, and this alarm was increased by a
report from France that Louis XIV, with whom James
was known to be closely allied, and on whom he
depended, like his late brother, for pecuniary support,
had revoked the Edict of Nantes granted by Henry
IV in favour of his Protestant subjects. The report
was soon confirmed by the appearance of numbers of
French Protestants—refugees from persecution—in
England, and more especially in the city of London.
What Louis had done in France James, it was feared,
would carry out in England by means of his standing
army commanded by Roman Catholic officers. Hence
the alarm which pervaded not only parliament, but
also the city and the nation at large.</p>

Commission Court, with the infamous Jeffreys at its
head, the first act of which was to suspend the Bishop
of London for upholding the Protestant faith. He
removed the Earl of Clarendon (son of the late Chancellor),
who had recently been appointed Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 91. fo. 23.</p></note> and appointed as lord deputy the
Earl of Tyrconnel, a Roman Catholic of low character,
who had gained an unenviable notoriety as the "lying
Dick Talbot." The country was over-run with Papists
from abroad. All the laws against the exercise of the
Roman Catholic religion were set at defiance. There
was no disguise. Mass was publicly celebrated at
Whitehall and Roman Catholic chapels sprang up
everywhere, giving rise to no small dissatisfaction and
tumult. The agitation in London was great, but greater
in the city, where men had been less accustomed to the<pb n="517" /><anchor id="Pg517" />
sight of the Romish ceremonial than those who lived
in the neighbourhood of the court. Riots in the city
were of frequent occurrence, more especially on Sundays,
when the Roman Catholics were more in evidence
than on week days. A Roman Catholic chapel had
recently been erected by the Elector Palatine in Lime
Street. An ineffectual attempt had been made by the
mayor and aldermen to stay the work. They were
summoned to appear before the king and reprimanded.
The work was accordingly allowed to go on and the
chapel was opened. On Sunday, the 18th April (1686),
the priests attached to the chapel were followed by a
mob into Cheapside, and matters would have gone hard
with them had not the mayor and aldermen appeared
on the scene with a regiment of trained bands. James
again sent for the mayor and told him that if he could
not keep better order in the city he should himself send
some "assistance."<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 373-375.</p></note> Nevertheless another riot broke
out on the following Sunday. A mob entered a Roman
Catholic chapel and carried away a crucifix, crying
out they would have no "wooden gods." A cross
was set up on the parish pump and mock obeisance
made to it. The priests were insulted, but no violence
was offered them. When the mayor appeared to
quell the tumult the crowd affected to disbelieve
that his lordship was in earnest. "What! the lord
mayor of our city come to preach up popery! too
sure, it cannot be!" When the trained bands were
ordered to disperse the crowd they declared that
in conscience they could not hinder them in their
work.<note place="foot"><p>Ellis Correspondence, 27 April, 1686, 2nd series, iv, 94.</p></note></p>

port of London. A regiment or two of the standing
army which James had formed might any day appear
in the city. "I shall not wonder if the Scotch regiment

<p>For a time James had entertained the hope of
obtaining favours for the Catholics with the goodwill
of the Church of England, whilst continuing the persecution
of dissenters. Finding this impossible he
determined to make friends of the dissenters, and to
include them in a general declaration of indulgence.
Accordingly on the 4th April, 1687, there appeared a
Declaration of Indulgence suspending all laws against
Roman Catholics and dissenters alike.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 191a.</p></note></p>

<p>James would willingly have obtained parliamentary

this end he again took to tampering with corporations
throughout the country, in the hope of securing thereby
a parliament favourable to his policy of toleration.
Six commissioners were appointed in November to
"regulate" all the corporations of England, by turning
out all who were opposed to the abolition of the penal
laws and Test Act and putting in their place those who<pb n="519" /><anchor id="Pg519" />

places taken by dissenters.<note place="foot"><p>"There has been a review in the several companies of London:

number of about 900 persons, insomuch that some have esteemed it a
scandall to be kept in."—Luttrell, i, 415.</p></note> Everywhere dissenters
were treated with the greatest consideration. Notwithstanding
every effort, however, to capture the constituencies
at the next elections, James found public
opinion against him to be too strong, and all thought
of summoning a fresh parliament had to be abandoned.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The king and the Court of Aldermen, June, 1687.</p></note>

<p>In the meanwhile addresses flowed in from
various parts of the country thanking the king for his
declaration. Presbyterians, Quakers, Independents,
Congregationalists alike sent addresses, but as yet no
address was presented on behalf of the Court of
Aldermen—the governing body of the city, now
that the Common Council was in abeyance. That
body had to be largely remodelled before it would
consent to present any such address. On Thursday,
the 16th June, the infamous Jeffreys, who had been
rewarded with the seals for his work at the Bloody
Assizes, appeared before the Court of Aldermen and
declared his majesty's pleasure that in future that
court should nominate and recommend to the Crown
such persons as they thought fit to be aldermen as
vacancies occurred, and that no one so nominated<pb n="520" /><anchor id="Pg520" />
should be exempt from service except for insufficiency
of estate, to be declared on oath. Those who were
capable of serving and refused to serve when
nominated by the court were to be fined, and the
fines were to be devoted to the use and benefit of the
city's orphans. The ancient privilege, too, of the
mayor drinking to a future sheriff received the king's
sanction.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 92, fo. 274.</p></note> Having listened to the lord chancellor's

but they experienced great difficulty in getting
any one to serve sheriff or alderman. Fines ran up
apace, until no less than £8,500 had been paid by persons
desirous at any cost to be discharged from filling
either of those thankless offices. Many of the aldermen
either voluntarily resigned their gowns or were
dismissed from the court because they were unwilling to

refused to join in any address of thanks for the

declined to enter into any negotiations on the matter

influential Baptist in the city, succumbed to the
threats, if not to the blandishments, of James.<note place="foot"><p>See "The life of Mr. William Kiffin, upwards of sixty years pastor
of the Baptist church, Devonshire square, London, from 1639 to 1701;

when that popish and despotic monarch disfranchised the city of
London," by Joseph Ivimey, London, 1833.</p></note> In
addition to possessing spiritual gifts of no mean
order, Kiffin was also a man of wealth and position
in the world of commerce. In every way he would
prove a valuable ally, if only he could be won over.
Against this, however, there was one great impediment:
the recollection of the judicial murder of
his two grandsons, Benjamin and William Hewling,
by Jeffreys at the Bloody Assizes. Fondly imagining
that the memory of that foul act could be blotted
out and the stricken heart salved by an increase
of wealth or elevation in rank, James sent for him
to court, and after some preliminary remarks touching
the royal favour that was being shown to dissenters,
told Kiffin that he had put him down as an alderman
in his "new charter," alluding no doubt to the royal
commission of 6th August, in which Kiffin's name
appears as alderman of Cheap ward in the place of<pb n="522" /><anchor id="Pg522" />
Samuel Dashwood. On hearing this Kiffin replied,
"Sir, I am a very old man,"—he was seventy years
of age when he lost his grandchildren—"I have withdrawn
myself from all kind of business for some
years past, and am incapable of doing any service
in such an affair to your majesty or the city.
Besides, sir," the old man continued, with tears
running down his cheeks, and looking the king
steadily in the face, "the death of my grandsons
gave a wound to my heart which is still bleeding,
and never will close but in the grave." For a
moment the king was abashed, but quickly recovering
himself told Kiffin that he (James) would find "a
balsam for that sore." The old man still held out,
until, hearing that legal proceedings were about to be
taken against him, he took counsel's opinion as to
what was best to be done. He was told that he was
running a great risk by refusing to become an
alderman, for the judges, as they then were, might
subject him to a penalty of ten, twenty, or thirty
thousand pounds, "even what they pleased." Under
such circumstances he consented to be made an
alderman, rather than bring ruin on himself and family.
He, however, put off the evil day as long as he could,
and was not sworn into office until the 27th October.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 92, fo. 525.</p></note></p>

<p>Kiffin expressed himself as pleased with the
reception he met with in his ward, where he was
almost a stranger. But much of the business which
the Court of Aldermen was called upon to execute
in those days was distasteful to him. "We had
frequently orders from the king" (he writes) "to<pb n="523" /><anchor id="Pg523" />
send to the several companies to put out great
numbers of liverymen out of the privilege of being
liverymen, and others to be put in their rooms;
most of which that were so turned out were
Protestants of the Church of England. There has
been a list of seven hundred at a time to be discharged,
although no crime laid to their charge."
The royal commission which appointed him an
alderman also created him a justice of the peace and
a member of the Court of Lieutenancy, but to use his
own words, "I never meddled with either of those
places, neither in any act of power in that court
[<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">i.e.</foreign>, Court of Aldermen] touching causes between
man and man, but only such things as concerned
the welfare of the city and good of the orphans,
whose distressed condition called for help, although

called upon to discharge his invidious duties for any
great length of time; for after being in office only
nine months he obtained his discharge, to his "very
great satisfaction." He continued to live for another
thirteen years, dying on the 29th December, 1701, in
his 86th year, and he was buried in Bunhill Fields—that
"God's acre" which holds the dust of so many
of his fellow non-conformists.</p>

<p>In September the king had issued a patent for
Sir John Shorter to be lord mayor for the year
ensuing. Shorter was a dissenter—"an Anabaptist,
a very odd ignorant person, a mechanic, I think,"
wrote Evelyn<note place="foot"><p>Diary, i, 643.</p></note> of him—and on that account a clause
was inserted in his commission permitting him to
have any preacher he might choose.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 414.</p></note>  His granddaughter<pb n="524" /><anchor id="Pg524" />
was married to Sir Robert Walpole. He
was at one time alderman of Cripplegate ward, but
in December, 1682, he fell foul of Charles II for
attending a conventicle at Pinmakers' Hall, and the
Court of Aldermen received orders to remove him.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 88, fos. 43b, 90b.</p></note>
He had recently, however (6 Aug., 1687), been
restored to his aldermanry and to his rank of precedence
by commission from James,<note place="foot"><p>Original commission preserved in the Town Clerk's office.</p></note> and now, by the same
usurped authority, he was to become lord mayor.
The feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.) happening
this year to fall on a Friday, the installation
of the new lord mayor, as well as the banquet to
which James and the Papal Nuncio had been invited,
was postponed until the following day. The aldermen
agreed to defray the cost of the entertainment
out of their own pockets,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 92, fo. 496.</p></note> each laying down the sum
of £50. Kiffin also sent £50, although he had not yet
been sworn a member of the court; but he afterwards
regretted having done so when he learnt that
the Pope's Nuncio and other priests had been invited
as guests.<note place="foot"><p>Kiffin's Autobiographies ("Life of Kiffin," by Joseph Ivimey),
pp. 88, 89.</p></note> The day passed off well. The Goldsmiths'
Company, of which the new lord mayor
was a member, made a particularly brave show.
The entire roadway from Charing Cross to the
city had been fresh gravelled that morning, and the
king, who was accompanied by the queen, expressed
himself as well pleased with the entertainment
afforded him.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 417, 418.</p></note></p>

<p>The Dissenters now had matters all their own

with an influx of new members, whose claim for
admittance rested chiefly on their antagonism to the
established Church, that most of them now sent in
addresses to the king thanking him for his Declaration
of Indulgence. The Barber-Surgeons and the Apothecaries
had already done so; so had the Clothworkers,
the Mercers and the Glovers. Their example was
now followed by the Cutlers, the Goldsmiths, the
Haberdashers, the Joiners and the Weavers.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 416, 418, 420.</p></note> The

<index index="toc" level1="The second Declaration of Indulgence." /><note place="margin"><p>The second Declaration of Indulgence, 27 April, 1688.</p></note>

<p>In the Spring of 1688 James published a second
Declaration of Indulgence varying but slightly from
the former one, and ordered it to be read in the
churches of London and Westminster on the 20th and
27th May, and in the country on the 3rd and 10th
June. This was more than the clergy could stand.
A meeting of bishops was held at Lambeth for the
purpose of drawing up a petition to the king praying<pb n="526" /><anchor id="Pg526" />
that the clergy might be excused reading an illegal
document in the midst of public service. This petition
was signed by Sancroft, the primate, and six bishops.
Although the Bishop of London was not among
those who signed the petition—he at the time being
under disability—there is reason for believing that
Compton had been taken into counsel by those who
drafted it.<note place="foot"><p>Lingard, xiv, 195-197.</p></note> On the petition being presented James
pretended the utmost surprise, and insisted that the
presentation of such a petition was "a standard of
rebellion." This took place on Friday preceding the
first Sunday (20th May) when the Declaration was
to be read in the London churches. When Sunday
arrived people flocked to the churches to hear what
would happen. Only a few of the London clergy
attempted to read the Declaration.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 440.</p></note> In the country
not more than 200 clergy carried out the king's orders,
"and of these some read it the first Sunday, but
changed their minds before the second; others
declared in their sermons that though they obeyed
the order they did not approve the Declaration."
One minister in particular told his congregation that
though he was obliged to read it they were not obliged
to hear it, and waited until all had left the church
before he commenced reading the hateful document.
In other places the congregation took the initiative
and rose to go as soon as the minister commenced
reading it.<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, iii, 229.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The seven bishops committed to the Tower.</p></note>

<p>What followed is well known. On Friday the
8th June the Archbishop of Canterbury and the six
bishops who had signed the petition were summoned<pb n="527" /><anchor id="Pg527" />
before the council and asked if they acknowledged
their respective signatures. They were next required
to enter into bond for appearance before the King's
Bench. This they declined to do, and were thereupon
committed to the Tower.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 442.</p></note> To have carried them
through the streets of the city might have caused a
riot; they were therefore conveyed to the Tower by
water, "and all along as they passed the banks of the
river were full of people, who kneeled down and
asked their blessing, and with loud shouts expressed
their good wishes for them and their concern in their
preservation."<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, iii, 232.</p></note> The enthusiasm of the Londoners
did not end here. They continued to flock to the
Tower, filling the small chapel where the bishops
attended service to overflowing in order to gaze upon
their beloved pastors and receive their blessing.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 444.</p></note> After
being kept in separate confinement, and allowed to
meet only at meals and in chapel, for ten days, the
bishops were allowed to come out on bail.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The trial of the Seven Bishops." /><note place="margin"><p>Trial and acquittal of the bishops, 29 and 30 June, 1688.</p></note>

<p>On the 29th June they appeared before the
King's Bench on a charge of publishing a seditious
libel. A technical difficulty presented itself at the
outset, but this was got over, and after a trial of some
hours the question of their innocence or guilt was left
to a jury drawn, not from London, but from the
county of Middlesex. One of the panel stuck out
against the rest, and wished to bring in a verdict of
guilty, but after being locked up through the night he
allowed himself to be persuaded by his fellow-jurymen,
and on the morning of the 30th June a verdict of
not guilty was found. Thereupon "there were such
shoutings, so long continued, and as it were echoed<pb n="528" /><anchor id="Pg528" />
into the city, that all people were struck with it."<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, iii, 237.</p></note>
Bonfires were lighted, guns discharged and church bells
rung, not only in London but throughout the kingdom.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Disaffection among the troops at Hounslow.</p></note>

<p>The beginning of the end was approaching.
Already the troops encamped at Hounslow, on which
James placed so much dependence, showed signs of
disaffection. He had hoped that his army would
have overawed London, instead of which the free
spirit of London had, as a result of his policy, entirely
captivated his army. So long as the king was in their
midst the troops maintained a respectful demeanour,
but as soon as his back was turned they threw off all
restraint, and joined in the general exultation at the
late joyful deliverance to the Church of England.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 448; Burnet, iii, 236, 237.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The birth of Prince Charles Edward, 10 June, 1688.</p></note>

<p>The birth of a prince (10 June), which had
recently taken place, served to hasten the crisis.
Those who were willing to have waited patiently for
a recurrence to the old order of things at the king's
death now saw their hopes dashed to the ground.
The king's heir and successor, brought up, as he
undoubtedly would be, in the tenets of his father,
promised them little relief. Even before the birth of
the prince overtures had been made to William of
Orange to appear in England at the head of an army.
Nevertheless the Court of Aldermen displayed its
loyalty by resolving that the conduits in Cheapside
and at the Stocks Market should run with claret on
Thanksgiving-day. The sheriffs were to take the
matter in hand, whilst the sum of £50 was raised by
the court to defray the cost, the mayor contributing
£10, each of the sheriffs £5, and the rest of the<pb n="529" /><anchor id="Pg529" />
aldermen the balance between them.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 93, fo. 157.</p></note> Later on
(29 June) the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs waited
upon the infant prince and kissed his hand. The
various nurses were presented by the Chamberlain
with the respectable <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">douceur</foreign> of sixty guineas, whilst
ten guineas were given to the lord chancellor's

<index index="toc" level1="Invitation to William of Orange." /><note place="margin"><p>Invitation to William of Orange, 30 June, 1688.</p></note>

<p>The day that saw the bishops acquitted a letter was
despatched, signed by Shrewsbury, Danby, Compton
(the suspended Bishop of London) and others, to the
Prince of Orange, again inviting him to land in England
with an armed force, and promising to render him
every assistance. After some hesitation William accepted
the invitation, and began to make preparations,
both naval and military, for his descent on England.
Towards the close of September news came from
Holland of the vast preparations that were being
pushed forward in that country. A fleet of sixty sail
was in readiness, and the prince himself was shortly
expected on board. James lost no time in informing
the lord mayor of the state of affairs, and desired that
he and the aldermen would take measures for preserving
the city in peace.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 462.</p></note> On the 28th he issued a
proclamation informing his subjects of the threatened

<p>James saw, when it was too late, that he had
over-taxed the patience of his subjects. He was now<pb n="530" /><anchor id="Pg530" />
ready to make any and every concession. As for the
citizens of London, they should have their charter
restored. Accordingly, on Saturday the 6th October
Lord Chancellor Jeffreys appeared before the Court
of Aldermen with two separate grants under the
great seal, the one appointing Sir John Chapman to
be mayor (in the place of Sir John Eyles<note place="foot"><p>He had been appointed mayor by Letters Patent (7 Sept.) to
succeed Sir John Shorter, who had died from the effects of a fall from
his horse on the occasion of his opening St. Bartholomew fair in Smithfield

king's pleasure.</p></note>) up to the
feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.), with liberty
to the citizens in the meantime to elect one of their
own choice to be mayor for the year ensuing; the
other, continuing in office Sir Samuel Thompson and
Sir Humphrey Edwin, then sheriffs, until a new
election of sheriffs should be made by the citizens.
The newly-appointed mayor and the existing sheriffs
thereupon went down into the Guildhall, accompanied
by the lord chancellor, who informed the
citizens of the restitution of their liberties.<note place="foot"><p>The deed of restitution under the great seal, dated the 3rd October,
as well as Chapman's commission to be mayor, dated the 5th October
are preserved at the Guildhall (Charter Closet, Box No. 24).</p></note> The
mayor and sheriffs having taken the oaths and subscribed
the declaration prescribed by the Corporation
Act, the aldermen returned to their chamber, and
such as had been aldermen at the time of the
judgment upon the writ of <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign> and
were then present were forthwith sworn in for the
respective wards from which they had been deposed.
The court next proceeded to draw up an address to
the king, in which his majesty was assured that with
all duty and faithfulness they would cheerfully and
readily <emph>discharge the trust reposed in them</emph> to the<pb n="531" /><anchor id="Pg531" />
utmost hazard of their lives and fortunes.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 94, fos. 1-3.</p></note> One
cannot help noticing how studiously different the
wording of this address is from those previously
presented. Not a word about defending his majesty's
person with their lives and fortunes; these are thenceforth
to be expended in guarding their own liberties!
When the Court of Aldermen met three days later
(9 Oct.) the common sergeant, the town clerk, the
comptroller, swordbearer, common crier and other
officers who had been ousted from their places under
the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign> were formally re-instated;<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 4-5.</p></note> and the

Treby, who had been recorder at the time of the

finding great difficulty in getting a suitable person to
accept the appointment, Treby was finally induced
to change his mind, and before the end of the year
he occupied his old place and continued to occupy it

<p>The city was still without a Common Council,

The object of the meeting was to dissipate any doubt
that had been entertained as to the infant prince
being actually the king's son. There had been
rumours to the contrary, and as the king was about
to enter upon a dangerous enterprise in person, he
declared his intention of settling the question beyond
all doubt before leaving. Some twenty witnesses
were accordingly examined then and there as to the
prince's legitimacy, the king offering to send for the<pb n="533" /><anchor id="Pg533" />

proceeded to march upon London. At Exeter he was
well received, but some little time elapsed before the

afterwards known as the Duke of Marlborough, and the
greatest soldier of the age. Left almost alone, James
returned to London, having been absent from the
capital less than ten days. Like his name-sake the
Conqueror, William made no haste to reach London,
but advanced by slow marches, putting up at various
gentlemen's houses on the way. It was agreed that
both armies should remain at a distance of forty
miles from London in order to allow the new

<p>Since the news of the prince's landing there had

Clerkenwell, where rumour declared there were stored
gridirons, spits and other instruments for torturing

close all the Roman Catholic chapels except the royal
chapels and those belonging to foreign ambassadors.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 475.</p></note>

child in a place of security before he himself should
seek safety in flight. On the 11th December he
attempted to make good his escape. As soon as it
was known that the king had left London a great
number of lords, both spiritual and temporal, came to
the Guildhall, as to a place of security, the better to
consult and take measures for the common weal.
Having informed the Court of Aldermen of the king's

<p>By this time James, who had been foiled in his
first attempt to reach the coast, and had returned to
London, had, with the connivance of the Prince of
Orange, been more successful in a second attempt, and
had crossed over to France, where he spent the
remainder of his days. The country was therefore left
without king, parliament or legal system for its
government. In London the Corporation of the city
was almost the only authority that remained unaffected
by the king's abdication; and it is significant as well
of its power as of the respect which that body commanded
that when William was endeavouring to form
an authoritative assembly by summoning all the members
who had ever sat in parliament under Charles II,<note place="foot"><p>Members of James's parliament were not summoned on the
ground that, owing to the Corporations having suffered "regulations"

he likewise desired that the lord mayor of the city,
the entire Court of Aldermen and fifty representatives
of the Common Council should attend.<note place="foot"><p>Kennet, iii, 505.</p></note> This assembly
met on the 26th December, and after due consultation
decided to adopt the same procedure as was adopted
in 1660 before the return of Charles II. As there<pb n="538" /><anchor id="Pg538" />
was no king there could be no writs for a parliament,
but William could call a Convention, which would be
a parliament in everything but name. A Convention
was accordingly summoned to meet on the 22nd
January, 1689. The election of the city members to
serve in the convention was ordered to take place on
Wednesday the 9th January,<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 94, fo. 80.</p></note> when the choice of the
citizens fell upon their former well-tried representatives,

<p>In the meantime (8 Jan.) the prince wrote to
the civic authorities setting forth the inadequacy of
the revenue to supply three pressing wants. These
were the maintenance of the navy, the partial disbandment
of the army and the furnishing of a force
for the speedy relief of the Protestants in Ireland.
He desired the City, therefore, to advance him such a
sum as could be "conveniently spared."<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 365; Letter Book ZZ, fo. 135b; Journal 51, fo.
14b. The sum required by the prince is stated to have been £200,000,
of which sum Sir Samuel Dashwood is said to have subscribed no less
than £60,000.—Kennet, iii, 507; Maitland, i, 490.</p></note> The City
was still to keep up its character as the purse of the
nation. The Common Council, having heard the
letter read, at once resolved to assist the prince to
the utmost of their power. A committee was appointed
to settle with the revenue officers the nature
of the security, and orders were given for precepts
to be sent to the aldermen to raise subscriptions
in the various wards.<note place="foot"><p>Subscription lists of the several wards and other documents in

the exchequer all money received on account of the
loan, and to strike tallies for the same in his own
name in trust for the use of the several lenders. Ten
days later (18 Jan.) the committee reported the steps
taken for the security of repayment of the money
already paid into the exchequer, and the council
recommended that similar steps should be taken with
respect to those sums yet to be paid in. It was at
the same time unanimously agreed to ask the Prince
to dinner in the city, and the recorder, the sheriffs
and the common sergeant were instructed to wait on
his highness and learn his pleasure.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 365b; Letter Book ZZ, fo. 136b; Repertory 94. fo. 87.</p></note></p>

<p>On the 22nd January the Convention met. On
the 28th the Commons declared the throne to be
vacant, and on the 6th February a vote to similar
effect was passed by the Lords. Some over-zealous
inhabitants of the city had in the meanwhile prepared a
petition, which they purposed presenting to the House
of Lords, praying that the crown might be offered to
the Prince of Orange and his consort. The prince
ordered the lord mayor to put a stop to such proceedings,
and a precept (200 copies of which were ordered
to be printed) was accordingly issued to this effect.<note place="foot"><p>The precept is printed in Maitland's Hist. (i, 491). Only the

of a change of masters taking place between the time

new masters presented a petition to the Court of Claims
praying to have their names inserted in the place of
the former masters whose term of office had expired.
This petition was opposed by the Remembrancer, on
behalf of the City, on the ground that the masters
of the livery companies enjoyed no peculiar right
to serve on such occasions, and after some deliberation
the commissioners declined to interfere, inasmuch
as the power of nominating the twelve citizens rested
absolutely with the Court of Aldermen.<note place="foot"><p>Report in relation to the appointment of twelve citizens of London

<p>The Convention having been converted by a
formal Act into a true parliament (23 Feb.),<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, x, 31, 33, 34.</p></note> one of
the first motions put to the House was that a special
committee should be appointed to consider the violations
of the liberties and franchises of all the corporations
of the kingdom, "and particularly of the city
of London." The motion was lost by a majority of
24.<note place="foot"><p>Id., x, 35.</p></note> The House nevertheless resolved to bring in a
Bill for repealing the Corporation Act, and ten days
later (5 March) the Grand Committee of Grievances
reported to the House its opinion (1) that the rights
of the city of London in the election of sheriffs in
the year 1682 were invaded and that such invasion
was illegal and a grievance, and (2) that the judgment
given upon the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign> against the city was
illegal and a grievance. The committee's opinion on
these two points (among others) was endorsed by
the House, and on the 16th March it ordered a Bill to
be brought in to restore all corporations to the state
and condition they were in on the 29th May, 1660,
and to confirm the liberties and franchises which at
that time they respectively held and enjoyed.<note place="foot"><p>Id., x, 41, 51.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Further Report of Committee of Grievances, 29 May, 1689.</p></note>

<p>A special committee appointed (5 March) to
investigate the nature of the city's grievances, and to
discover who were the authors and advisers of them,<pb n="542" /><anchor id="Pg542" />
presented, on the 29th May, a long report to the
House,<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, x, 156-160.</p></note> giving the whole story of the election of
sheriffs in June, 1682, and of Pritchard's election
to the mayoralty in the following September; of
the fines that had been imposed on Pilkington,
Shute, Bethell, Cornish and others for so-called riots
whilst engaged in asserting the rights of the citizens;
of Papillon having been cast in damages to the
amount of £10,000 at the suit of Pritchard, and of
other matters which led up to the proceedings under
the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign>, when, as the committee had discovered,
two of the justices of the King's Bench—Pemberton
and Dolben—were removed from the court
because their opinion was found to be in favour of the
city. The committee refer to the City's Records in
support of the claim of the lord mayor to elect one of
the sheriffs, and say "that from the twenty-first of
Edward the III<hi rend="vertical-align: super">d</hi> unto the year 1641 the way of
making sheriffs was that the lord mayor named one
to be sheriff and presented him to the Common
Hall, who did confirm him, and chose another to act
with him; except in three or four years within that
time, when the Common Hall chose both the sheriffs,
the persons drank to in those years by the lord
mayor having refused to hold and paid their fines."
They capitulated to the House the various occasions
on which the mayor exercised his prerogative unchallenged,
and those when the Common Hall refused
to confirm the mayor's nomination, down to 1682,
when matters were brought to a crisis by Sir John
Moore claiming to have <emph>elected</emph> Dudley North by
drinking to him according to custom; and in conclusion<pb n="543" /><anchor id="Pg543" />
they reported their opinion to be that Sir John Moore
and Dudley North were among the "authors of
the invasion made upon the rights of the city of
London in the election of sheriffs for the said city in
the year 1682."</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Draft Bill for reversal of judgment submitted to Common Council, 24 May, 1689.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime the civic authorities themselves
had not been idle. The Common Council had already
(1 March) appointed a committee to take steps for
obtaining a reversal of the judgment on the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo
Warranto</foreign> with the assistance of the recorder and the
city's representatives in parliament. Before the end
of May a draft Bill had been prepared for the purpose
and been submitted to the court for approval.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fos. 366, 373b-377b; Letter Book ZZ, fo. 137b.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Pecuniary difficulties in connexion with City Orphans." /><note place="margin"><p>The Court of Orphans.</p></note>

<p>There was another matter pressing very heavily
upon the City just now, and one which later on would
also claim the attention of parliament, and that
was the relationship of the civic authorities to the
city orphans. By the custom of London the mayor
and aldermen were the recognised guardians of all
citizens' orphans, and as such took charge of their
property until they came of age or married. A
Court of Orphans was established, with the common
sergeant as its chief officer, which exercised the same
jurisdiction over the bodies and goods of orphans in
the city that the Court of Chancery exercised outside.
In course of time the fund paid into this court became
very considerable, and in order to prevent it lying
idle and thus deprive the orphans of interest that
might accrue on their estate, the court lent large sums
to the Crown on the security of exchequer bills.
Could any guardian or trustee have acted more<pb n="544" /><anchor id="Pg544" />
honestly or with greater prudence? They had not
reckoned, however, upon a king being on the throne
who should be sufficiently dishonest to stop all payments
out of the exchequer in discharge of principal
and interest of past loans. This is what Charles II
did, as we have seen, in 1672; and his action not only
ruined many bankers and merchants of the city, but
inflicted great hardship upon the city's fatherless
children. The City's revenue at the time of William's
accession was little more than sufficient to meet the
necessary expenses of the municipality, to say
nothing of repaying the orphans their confiscated
estates. This fact was recognised by the orphans
themselves, who saw no other hope but to apply to
parliament for assistance with the aid of the Common
Council.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Orphans' petition to Common Council, 1 March, 1689.</p></note>

<p>To this end "a large number" of orphans of the
city presented a petition to the court on the 1st March.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fos. 366, 366b.</p></note>
Their fortunes (they said) had been paid into the
Chamber of London according to the custom of
the city, and they were now left destitute of
support and reduced to great hardships and extremities,
very many of them having their whole
portions in the Chamber. They prayed the court,
therefore, to appoint a committee to consider the
whole matter with the view of approaching parliament
with some recommendation. To this the court
readily gave its consent, and a committee was then
and there nominated.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Proposals of committee, 8 March, 1689.</p></note>

<p>A week later (8 March) this committee made
a report to the council.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 369.</p></note> They had found upon<pb n="545" /><anchor id="Pg545" />
investigation that the debt owing by the Chamber
was very great, being upwards of £500,000 due on
principal money to orphans and nearly £100,000
more due to others, besides "finding money" and
interest. The committee were of opinion that before
any application was made to parliament the City
should first do what it could on its own account for
the relief of the orphans. The City's lands of
inheritance were estimated as bringing in about
£4,000 a year, subject to a charge of £500 or £600
for charitable uses, and the committee recommended
that lands to the value of £3,000 a year rental
should be sold. By this means it was thought that
£70,000 or thereabouts would be raised, and the
sum being devoted to the relief of the orphans would
be "a good introduction to request a further assistance
from the parliament." The charges of municipal
government must be met with the residue of the
"casual profits" of the Chamber. If parliament (the
report went on to say) would be pleased to assist by
granting a duty on coals and allowing the City to
tax hackney coachmen at 5<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> a head, the whole
debt, or at least the principal, might be liquidated.
A Bill which the committee had prepared for presentation
to parliament for this purpose was then
read and referred to the town clerk and the city
solicitor, as well as to the attorney and the solicitor-general
for their opinions.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The king's proposal to abolish the Hearth Tax, 1 March, 1689.</p></note>

<p>The king's intimation to the House (1 March)
that he was prepared, with its assent, to abolish the

The Commons immediately voted an address of
thanks, and passed a formal resolution to stand by<pb n="546" /><anchor id="Pg546" />

his alliances abroad, in the reduction of Ireland, and

Common Council of the city resolved to present a
humble address of thanks to his majesty for the
welcome relief from a tax that had been from its
commencement obnoxious. The court at the same
time resolved to return its thanks to both Houses
of Parliament for their resolution to stand by the
king.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 369b; Luttrell, i, 509, 510.</p></note> The Commons, in acknowledging the address,
represented to the deputation by the mouth of the
Speaker that they had taken notice of the courage and
constancy displayed by the City in the late revolution,
and more especially its action in advancing so large a
sum of money to his majesty at so critical a time.

receive the like return from the Commons.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, x, 46, 47.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Death of Lord Mayor Chapman, 17 March, 1689.</p></note>

<p>On Sunday the 17th March a special Court of
Aldermen sat. The lord mayor, Sir John Chapman,
had died at ten o'clock that morning, and it became
necessary to take steps for the election of a mayor to
serve for the remainder of the mayoralty year, and to
secure, in the meantime, the peace of the city. Three
aldermen were despatched, accompanied by the town
clerk, to inform the king of the state of affairs, and
to assure him that care would be taken to prevent
disorder until a new mayor should be elected. To
secure this latter object a precept was at once issued
by the court for a double watch to be kept until
further orders, whilst another precept was issued for<pb n="547" /><anchor id="Pg547" />
a Common Hall to meet on the following Wednesday
(20 March) for the election of a new mayor.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 94, fos. 124, 125.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Pilkington, Mayor, loco Chapman, deceased." /><note place="margin"><p>Pilkington elected Mayor, 20 March, 1689.</p></note>

<p>When the Common Hall met the choice of the
citizens fell upon their old friend and champion,
Pilkington, and Thomas Stampe; but a poll was
demanded by the supporters of two other candidates,
viz., Sir John Moore—who had already served
(1681-2) and in whose mayoralty there had been such
a fight over the election of sheriffs—and Jonathan
Raymond. It is said that the Tory party in the city
put up Moore for re-election by way of showing their
disgust at a recent resolution passed by the House of
Commons to the effect that Moore had been a betrayer
of the liberties of the City during his mayoralty.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 513, 514.</p></note> But
however that may be (and no record of such a resolution
appears in the Journal of the House), the result
of the poll placed Stampe and Pilkington—with 1975
and 1973 votes respectively—far ahead of either of the
other candidates. Moore, indeed, was at the bottom
of the poll with only 780 votes, whilst Raymond only
polled 930. Stampe and Pilkington having been
returned to the Court of Aldermen for them to select
one, according to the custom, they chose Pilkington,
and he was accordingly admitted and sworn mayor
for the remainder of the year, being presented to the
Governor of the Tower by order of the king instead
of before the barons of the exchequer.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fo. 1.</p></note> A few weeks

<p>At Midsummer (1689) a difficulty again arose
with the election of sheriffs for the ensuing year. The<pb n="548" /><anchor id="Pg548" />
Common Hall elected Christopher Lethieullier, alderman
and dyer, and John Houblon, grocer,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fo. 4.</p></note> but these
preferring to pay a fine to serving, the Common Hall
refused to elect others in their place. The Court of
Aldermen, finding themselves in a fix, sent for the
attorney-general to peruse the City's Records and to
give his advice in the matter. Lethieullier had determined
to cut all connection with the Corporation, and
had paid another fine to be relieved of the aldermanry
of the ward of Coleman Street. Nevertheless, by the
10th September both he and Houblon had been
persuaded to change their minds, and professed
themselves ready, if the Court of Aldermen so willed,
to take upon themselves the office of sheriffs.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 95, fos. 34, 43b.</p></note></p>

<p>The wheel of fortune had taken a sudden turn.

and in October, Ralph Box, who had refused

honour, as master of the Grocers' Company, of
conferring the freedom of the company upon the king,

<p>William had achieved the crown of England
without bloodshed. In Ireland, as well as in Scotland,
he had to fight for his crown. The news that James
had landed in Ireland (12 March) created no small
excitement in the city. Volunteers were called for,
and were readily found. The trained bands were
augmented and new officers appointed.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, i, 515, 516.</p></note> When it was
found that James was marching to the north of Ireland,
where the citizens of London held a large interest, the
excitement was increased. On the 18th April he
appeared before the walls of Londonderry, expecting
the city to immediately surrender. Thanks to the
strength of those walls, repaired and fortified by the
care and at the charges of the citizens of London,<note place="foot"><p>In the porch of Londonderry Cathedral there is a mural tablet

and still more to the stout hearts behind them,
the town was able to stand a long and dreary
siege, with all its attendant horrors of slaughter
and starvation, and at last, after heroic resistance and
patient suffering for 105 days, to come off victorious.
There is one name more especially honoured in connection
with the famous siege, that of George Walker,
who, although a clergyman and advanced in years,
inspired the besieged with so much energy and
courage that from first to last there was no thought
of surrender. Attempts were made to win over the
garrison by intrigue, and among the devices set on
foot for establishing communication between besiegers
and the besieged was that of placing a letter in
an empty shell and firing the latter into the town.<note place="foot"><p>"A true account of the siege of Londonderry," by the Rev. Mr.

cathedral of Londonderry, showing a shell which was used for the purpose
above mentioned and the mural tablet mentioned in the preceding note.</p></note>
When Walker made his appearance in England he

those corporations that had <emph>surrendered</emph> their charters,
and a great struggle took place upon the committee's
report (2 Jan., 1690) over an attempt to introduce a
clause providing that every municipal officer who had
in any way been a party to the surrender of a borough's

in that borough for a period of seven years.<note place="foot"><p>Id., x, 322, 323, 329, 330.</p></note> The

them. London was therefore excepted out of this

<p>On the 6th February, 1690, the Convention
Parliament was dissolved. Its greatest achievement
had been the passing of the Bill of Rights, the third
Great Charter (as it has been called) of English
liberties. The Bill of Rights embodied the provisions
of the Declaration of Rights, and strictly regulated
the succession to the crown. It constituted the title-deed
by which the king was thenceforth to hold his
throne, and the people to enjoy their liberties. The
late parliament had been none too liberal to William
in the matter of supply. Money was much needed
for carrying on war with France and for reducing
Ireland. Extraordinary aids were voted from time
to time, but the money came in so slowly that the
king was fain to seek advances from the City.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 25b, 28b, 29, 32, 101.</p></note> A

<p>The election of members to serve the City in
the coming parliament took place on the 19th
February, and was hotly contested. There appears
to be no record extant among the City's archives of
what took place, but from a petition laid before the
new House (2 April) by Pilkington (the lord mayor)
and three others, viz., Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Patience
Ward and Sir William Ashurst<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, x, 363.</p></note>—all professing
more or less Whig principles—we learn that they
claimed to have been elected by the Common Hall.
A poll had been granted, and a scrutiny was in course
of being held when (as they complained) the sheriffs
declared the election to have gone against them.
The petitioners had afterwards learnt that upon the<pb n="554" /><anchor id="Pg554" />
completion of the scrutiny the majority of those that
had a right to vote had proved to be in their favour.
They prayed therefore for relief. Their petition
was referred to the Committee of Privileges and
Elections for them to consider and report thereon
to the House; but nothing came of it. It was in
vain that Pilkington issued precepts to the livery
companies for returns to be made: (1) of the names
of those who were on the livery at Midsummer,
1683; (2) of those who had been admitted since;
(3) of those that had died since 1683, or who were
absent; and (4) of those who had omitted to take
the prescribed oaths for a freeman or liveryman—in
order to affect the scrutiny.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 26b, 28, 28b.</p></note> The result was declared
to be in favour of two aldermen and two commoners
of distinct Tory proclivities. These were Sir William
Pritchard, Sir Samuel Dashwood, Sir William Turner
(once an alderman and soon to become one again)
and Sir Thomas Vernon. Upon Turner's death in

<note place="margin"><p>The matter allowed to drop, 11 Dec., 1690.</p></note>

<p>The state of affairs was at length brought to the

members of the Common Council and presented to
the House of Commons on the 3rd December.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, x, 492.</p></note> The
petitioners explained to the House that they had
conceived and hoped that the late Act would have
restored the city to its ancient rights and privileges.
It had, however, done quite the contrary. They
then proceeded to relate how, notwithstanding the
Act, several aldermen of the city who had been
appointed by commissions under the late king continued
to act as such by virtue of certain doubtful
expressions in the Act; that by their illegally assumed
authority Pilkington had been declared and made
mayor, although not duly returned by the Common
Hall; that by the contrivance of the said mayor and<pb n="557" /><anchor id="Pg557" />
the aldermen Leonard Robinson had been made chamberlain,
notwithstanding another having been declared
duly elected by the sheriffs, and the Common Hall had
been thereupon dissolved. Nor was this all. The
petitioners went on to complain that divers members of
the Common Council had been illegally excluded, whilst
others who had been duly elected had been refused
admittance; that the place of town clerk having been
vacant for three months and more—an office, they
remind the House, of great trust in the city and one
to which only the Common Council had the right of
appointment—the mayor and aldermen had of their
own authority appointed several persons to execute
the office against the consent of the Common Council;
that the petitioners had not been allowed to meet and
consult about the necessary affairs of the city according
to their ancient rights and customs; and that a Common
Council having met on the 3rd October, and a
majority of the members having agreed upon the
presentation of a humble address to parliament with
the view of explaining the recent Act and settling the
rights of the city, the mayor refused to allow the
question to be put and immediately dissolved the court.
The petitioners therefore, finding all their ancient
rights and privileges thus invaded, prayed the House
to grant them relief. Having heard the petition read
the House ordered a copy of it to be given to the
mayor and aldermen,<note place="foot"><p>On the 4th December the Court of Aldermen appointed a committee
to draw up a defence.—Repertory 95, fo. 201b.</p></note> and appointed Monday, the 8th
December, for hearing both parties by themselves or
by counsel. Accordingly, on that day the petitioners
were heard by their counsel, and divers witnesses<pb n="558" /><anchor id="Pg558" />
were examined, after which the further hearing was
postponed until the morrow. On the 9th the case of
the mayor and aldermen was opened by counsel and
was continued on the 10th and the 11th, when by a
majority of thirteen it was decided to adjourn the
matter for a week.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, x, 501, 503.</p></note> It never was taken up again,
parliament being probably unwilling to run the risk of

be the cause of stopping the flow of money into the
coffers of the exchequer.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 141. The diarist ascribes the petition to Papist

<note place="margin"><p>The king sets out for Ireland, 4 June, 1690.</p></note>

<p>As early as January, 1690, William had made up
his mind to go to Ireland in person for the purpose of
reducing the country into subjection, but although
every effort was made to push on the necessary preparations
nearly six months elapsed before he was
ready to set out. On the 30th May the assistance of
the City was invoked. The Common Council willingly
agreed to raise money to assist the king in his enterprise,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 48, 48b, 99b.</p></note>
and on the 2nd June the mayor waited on his
majesty at Kensington Palace, accompanied by the
recorder, the aldermen and the sheriffs, and wished
him a prosperous journey, promising at the same time
to secure the good government of the city during his
absence.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 50.</p></note> On the 4th William set sail, and ten days
later (14 June) landed at Carrickfergus. His arrival
was a surprise to James, who flattered himself that
the state of affairs in parliament and "the distractions
of the city" would not allow of his leaving England.<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, "Hist. of His Own Time," iv, 85.</p></note><pb n="559" /><anchor id="Pg559" />
During the king's absence the queen took an active
part in the administration of the kingdom, and by her
tact and kindliness won many friends. As soon as it
was known that William had safely landed in Ireland
the sheriffs were deputed by the Court of Aldermen to
attend her majesty and desire when the court might
wait upon her to offer its congratulations upon the
good fortune that had so far attended the king.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 95, fo. 141.</p></note></p>

<p>The defeat of a combined English and Dutch

was found in the news of William's victory at the
Boyne. Seeing that a French force might any day be
expected in England, the government, as was its wont,
turned to the city of London. On the 7th July the

as to the numerical strength of the City's militia,
and more especially as to the number of horse and
dragoons the City could raise on an emergency. The

horses they could supply on an emergency like the

the mayor and aldermen and a deputation of the

in council and assured her of their loyalty. The
city militia, the queen was informed, consisted of
about 9,000 men, well equipt and ready for active
service, and six regiments of auxiliaries were about
to be raised. As to the horse and dragoons, the
Common Council had unanimously resolved to raise
by voluntary contributions a large regiment of horse
and 1,000 dragoons, and to maintain them for a month
if need be. We have seen how jealous in former days
the city had been in the matter of appointing its own
officers over its own forces, but now all signs of
jealousy were wanting, and the queen herself was
desired to appoint officers over the cavalry that was

left to the Dutch General Ginkell, afterwards created

on Midsummer-day, 1691, a motion had been made
in the Common Council on the 18th June (immediately
after the court had agreed to lend the queen
£120,000) for repealing the clause in the Act of
Common Council of the 6th June, 1683, touching the<pb n="564" /><anchor id="Pg564" />
confirmation of one of the sheriffs of the city and
county of Middlesex chosen by the mayor for
the time being. A debate thereupon arising the
previous question was put, and was declared by the
lord mayor to be carried. A poll, however, was
demanded, when the previous question was lost by
35 votes to 30, and the original motion being
afterwards put was carried by 30 votes to 29.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fo. 83b.</p></note> Such
is the narrative of what took place in the Common
Council on the 18th June, 1691, as related in the
Journal of the court, according to which the clause
in the Act of 1683 would have been repealed. We
know however, as a matter of fact, that the clause
was not repealed until three years later.<note place="foot"><p>By Act of Common Council, 15 June, 1694.</p></note> An explanation
is afforded us by Luttrell, the diarist, who says
that the minority against repealing the clause immediately
withdrew from the court "so there were
not enough left to make a Common Council, so the
Act continues in force."<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 250.</p></note> He adds that the mayor
(Pilkington) thereupon went to the Bridge House and
drank to Sir William Ashurst as a "recommendatory
sheriff" for the ensuing year to hold office only on
condition that the choice should be approved by the
Common Hall, "otherwise no good sheriff." When
Midsummer-day arrived, the common sergeant having
asked the Court of Aldermen for instructions as to how
to proceed to the elections, was ordered to "pursue such
directions as he should receive from the sheriffes, and
in his report of the elections, to declare it as the report
of the said sheriffes." The court further ordered that<pb n="565" /><anchor id="Pg565" />
the Common Hall should be opened by proclamation
in these words: "You good men of the livery of the
several companies of the city summoned to appear
here this day for the election of sheriffs and other
officers usually chosen at this time, draw near and
give your attendance, etc."<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 95, fo. 297b.</p></note> The claims of the
Livery in Common Hall to elect both sheriffs being
thus allowed, the electors were satisfied to pay the
mayor the compliment of electing Sir William
Ashurst, his nominee, to be one of the sheriffs, whilst
choosing Richard Levett to be the other. There
was another candidate in the person of William Gore.
A poll was demanded and allowed, the result of which
was declared on the 2nd July, when it appeared that
Ashurst had polled 3,631 votes, Levett 2,252 and
Gore 1,774. A keen contest again took place between
Sir Peter Rich and Leonard Robinson for the office
of chamberlain, in which the latter came off victorious.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fo. 84.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Bill rejected by Common Council.</p></note>

<p>In the spring of the next year (5 April, 1692)
the Court of Aldermen had before them a Bill, the
object of which was to settle the election and
confirmation of sheriffs for the future. After due
deliberation amongst themselves, and after consulting
the attorney-general upon its provisions, the Bill was
recommended to the Common Council to be passed
as an Act of that court.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 96, fos. 216, 244.</p></note> Of the particulars of the
Bill we are not informed. It was laid for the first
time before the Common Council on the 6th May,
when it was referred to a committee. On the
26th ult. it was read the first time and on the 31st
a second time, but upon the question being put<pb n="566" /><anchor id="Pg566" />
whether the Bill should be then read a third time it
passed in the negative,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 161, 167.</p></note> and nothing more is heard
of it.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Act of Common Council regulating Wardmote Elections." /><note place="margin"><p>Act of Common Council for regulating elections at wardmotes, 26 Oct., 1692.</p></note>

<p>A Bill for regulating the election of members of
the Common Council itself met with better success.
Of late years divers inhabitants of the city who were
not freemen (and among them the doctors and other
gentlemen of Doctors' Commons) had been in the
habit of exercising the franchise at wardmotes, to the
prejudice of freemen, to whom alone belonged the
right of voting. Many complaints having been made
to the Common Council of the rights of freemen
having been thus infringed,<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 167b, 187, 193.</p></note> an Act was at length
passed (26 Oct., 1692) declaring that the nomination
of aldermen and the election of common councilmen
for the several wards of the city appertained only to
freemen, being householders in the city, and paying
scot and bearing lot, a list of whom was thenceforth
to be prepared and kept by the beadle of each ward,
as well as a separate list of the other householders.
A copy of the Act was to be appended to all precepts
for wardmotes, and the provisions of the Act were to
be publicly read to the assembled electors.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 211.</p></note> At the
next election of a Common Council, which took place
in December, the Whigs, we are told, were, after a
hard fight, returned by "above 50 more voices than
last year."<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 319.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The king's return, Oct., 1691.</p></note>

<p>When William returned from abroad in October,
1691, it was to find Ireland completely subjugated.
The mayor and aldermen waited upon his majesty at
Whitehall, as usual, to congratulate him upon his<pb n="567" /><anchor id="Pg567" />
safe arrival. The king thanked them for the care
they had taken of the city during his absence, and
more particularly for supplying the queen with the
sum of £200,000 to enable her to carry on the
necessary affairs of the kingdom, and bestowed the
honour of knighthood on Richard Levett, one of the
sheriffs, Sir William Ashurst, the other sheriff, being
already knighted. Leaving Whitehall, the mayor
and aldermen next proceeded to Kensington to offer
their compliments to the queen and to thank her
majesty for her good government during the king's
absence.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 296.</p></note> A fortnight later (4 Nov.) the Common
Council resolved to pay their respects also to the
king and to congratulate him upon the success of his
arms in Ireland.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fo. 142; Luttrell, ii, 303</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Again sets out for Holland, March, 1692.</p></note>

<p>The king did not long remain in England. Early
in March of the following year (1692) he returned to
the Hague to make preparations for renewing the
war against France both by sea and land, leaving the
queen to carry on the government in England. On
the morning of the 12th March the mayor and
aldermen, accompanied by the recorder, proceeded
to Whitehall to offer the queen their congratulations
upon the receipt of news of the king's safe arrival in
Holland, as well as of her majesty's assumption of the
reins of government. The recorder assured her of the
City's loyalty, and desired her only to put it to the test.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 385.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>City loan of £200,000 to the queen, 18 March, 1692.</p></note>

<p>The City had not long to wait. Within a week
(18 March) application was made to the Common
Council, on behalf of the queen, for a loan of<pb n="568" /><anchor id="Pg568" />
£200,000.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 116, 160.</p></note> This was the first of the three loans of
that amount already mentioned as having been
advanced this year. The council readily consented
to raise the money, and so successful were their efforts
that within four days one-half of the whole loan was
already paid into the exchequer. By the king's
orders the whole of the £200,000 was kept intact
"for some extraordinary occasion."<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 395, 405.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Preparations to meet a threatened invasion by France, April, 1692.</p></note>

<p>Such an occasion was at hand. Whilst England
and Holland were preparing to make a joint attack on
France, France had been getting ready a navy for a
descent on England with the view of restoring James
to the throne. As soon as intelligence arrived of a
threatened invasion great excitement prevailed. This
was towards the close of April (1692). The trained
bands were called out, not only in the city, but
throughout the country, and more especially in those
counties bordering on the coast. The Court of Lieutenancy
had orders to administer the oaths to every
officer and man, and any that refused were to be
instantly cashiered and disarmed. The same with
Papists and all suspicious persons found in the city.
The oaths were to be tendered to them, and if any
refused to take them they were to be disarmed
and banished ten miles from the city.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fo. 121b; Luttrell, ii, 434, 435.</p></note> The mayor
issued instructions for closing coffee-houses in the
city on Sundays.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 429.</p></note> Troops that had been ordered
to Flanders were now countermanded, and a camp
was formed at Southampton.<note place="foot"><p>Id., ii, 429, 443-445.</p></note> The lord mayor was
given a commission as general of all the city's forces—trained<pb n="569" /><anchor id="Pg569" />
bands and auxiliaries—during the king's absence
abroad, and on the 10th May was complimented by her
majesty at the close of a review held in Hyde Park.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 447.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Naval victory at La Hogue." /><note place="margin"><p>Battle of La Hogue, 19 May, 1692.</p></note>

<p>At length—on the 19th May—the French fleet,
which was to cover the invasion of England, met the
combined Dutch and English fleet off La Hogue, and
was so signally beaten that all further thought of an
invasion had to be abandoned. News of the victory
reached London on the 21st, and was received with
every demonstration of joy. Medical aid was at
once despatched to tend the sick and wounded at
Portsmouth, whilst the hospitals were got ready to
receive those who should be brought to London.<note place="foot"><p>Id., ii, 460.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="More City loans." /><note place="margin"><p>City loan of £100,000 voted, 26 May.</p></note>

<p>The formal announcement of the victory to the
Common Council of the city (26 May) was thought
a fitting opportunity for asking for a further loan
of £100,000 to enable her majesty to pay and
"gratify" the seamen who had so gallantly warded
off invasion and to refit the fleet. It need scarcely
be said that the money was readily promised.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 123, 123b, 166.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>A further loan of £200,000 granted, 6 Sept., 1692.</p></note>

<p>This sum, however, proved altogether inadequate
for the purpose, so that by the end of August the
queen was compelled to send for the mayor and
aldermen and ask for £200,000 more. The mayor
promised to summon a Common Council at an early
date to consider the matter, and to further her
majesty's wishes to the best of his power.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 555.</p></note> A court
accordingly met on Tuesday the 6th September and
agreed to raise the money, as usual, by subscriptions
in the wards and from the livery companies,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 187b, 240.</p></note> and<pb n="570" /><anchor id="Pg570" />
within a very few days the mayor was able to signify

and to inform her that £70,000 had been already
subscribed.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, ii, 561.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The king entertained on lord mayor's day, 29 Oct., 1692</p></note>

<p>On the 18th October William once more set foot
in England, and at seven o'clock in the evening of
the 20th he passed through the city—the houses of
which were illuminated and the bells set ringing—to
Kensington. Two days later (22 Oct.) the mayor
and aldermen went in state to wait upon his majesty
to congratulate him upon his safe return, and to ask
him to favour them with his presence on the coming
lord mayor's day, when Sir John Fleet entered on
his year of office.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 96, fo. 504.</p></note> The king accepted the City's

<p>The same ill-success followed the arms of the
allied forces this year on the continent as in previous
years. But the fall of Mons in 1691, of Namur in
1692, and the bloody field of Landen this year were
far less disastrous in their effect to the Londoner than
the damage inflicted on the Turkey fleet of merchantmen
in Lagos Bay. For months the fleet, valued at
several millions, had been waiting to be convoyed to
the Mediterranean, and so great had been the delay in
providing it with a sufficiently strong escort that the
city merchant had already lost much of the profit he
had looked to derive from the voyage. When at
length a convoy was provided it was on the understanding
that the greater part of the force should
withdraw as soon as the most critical point of the
voyage should be passed, leaving but barely twenty<pb n="572" /><anchor id="Pg572" />
sail, under Rooke, to accompany the merchantmen
through the Straits of Gibraltar. It was in vain that
Rooke protested. The danger was the more hazardous
inasmuch as no one could say where the French fleet
was lying. Nevertheless, on the 5th June the main
fleet parted company and returned to the Channel,
leaving Rooke, with only seventeen men-of-war, to
look to his charge as best he could. As time went on
and no news could be got of the movements of the
French fleet the underwriters in the city got more
and more nervous.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, iii, 116, 125, 126, 131, 135-137, 139.</p></note> The end is well known. At Lagos
the English admiral found his passage blocked by the
French fleet. A sharp fight ensued, during which
many merchantmen succeeded in making good their
escape, others were burnt or sunk. "Never within the
memory of man," wrote Macaulay, "had there been
in the city a day of more gloom and agitation than
that on which the news of the encounter in the Bay
of Lagos arrived. Many traders, an eye-witness said,
went away from the Royal Exchange as pale as if
they had received sentence of death." The Turkey
merchants in their distress sent a deputation to the
queen.<note place="foot"><p>According to Luttrell (Diary, iii, 141, 142) the Turkey merchants
had desired the Court of Aldermen to present a petition to the queen on
their behalf, but the lord mayor declined on the ground that he ought to
have been first consulted on the matter. The merchants afterwards made
a similar application to the Common Council, but with no better success.</p></note> The deputation met with a kind reception,
and was assured by Somers, on the queen's behalf, of
her majesty's deep sympathy. An enquiry, he said,
had already been set on foot as to the cause of the
recent disaster, and care would be taken to prevent its
recurrence.</p>

<p>On the 15th August, after voting a loan of
£300,000 to her majesty for payment of the forces
in Flanders, the Common Council prepared an address
to the queen, in which they expressed their deep
sense of the infinite goodness of God in preserving
the king through all the perils of war, and thanked
her for the sympathy she had displayed with the
ruined merchants and for the steps she had taken
for the better protection of trade in future. To this
address a clause was added at the next meeting of the
court (17 Aug.) referring to their cheerful readiness to
advance a further sum of money for her majesty's
necessities, and assuring her of their firm resolution to
continue upon all occasions to support her authority
and government against all persons to the uttermost
of their power.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 272b-273b, 275.</p></note></p>

a studied insult or was the result of mere negligence
does not appear. But, however that may be, the
court marked its sense of their conduct by fining six

<index index="toc" level1="The Rise of the East India Company." /><note place="margin"><p>The rise of the East India Company, 1600-1689.</p></note>

<p>Soon after parliament resumed its sittings (7 Nov.,
1693) the attention of the Commons was drawn to a
high-handed act done by the wealthy and autocratic
company known as the East India Company. For
nearly a century that body of merchants had enjoyed
a monopoly of trade with the East Indies and had
frustrated all attempts of "interlopers" to share their
privileges. It had received its first charter at the
hands of Queen Elizabeth on the 31st December, 1600,
but it was not until after the Restoration, when its
privileges were confirmed by another charter, that it
began to enter upon a career of such unexampled
prosperity as to become at once an object of envy and
fear. The management of the company's affairs
rested in the hands of a small number of proprietors,
the leading spirit for many years being Sir Josiah
Child, one of the merchant princes of the city. With
him was associated, at least for a time, Thomas Papillon,
the zealous Whig. He had become a member of the
company as early as 1657, and for many years took
an active part in its management. He was one of the
directors from 1663 to 1670; was re-appointed in 1675,
but lost his seat on the board the following year, as
also did Child, through the intervention of Charles the
Second, who disliked their Whiggish principles. After
a short interval both of them recovered their positions,
and in 1680 and 1681 Papillon was deputy governor.<note place="foot"><p>"Memoirs of Thomas Papillon," by A.F.W. Papillon (Guildhall
Library), pp. 78-81.</p></note><pb n="576" /><anchor id="Pg576" />
When Child turned courtier and threw over his old
colleagues, Papillon and other Whig shareholders sold
their stock and severed their connection with the
company. Their places on the directorate were filled
up by others who were devoted to Child and his policy,
and thenceforth Child became the autocrat of the
company. "The treasures of the company were
absolutely at his disposal.... A present of ten
thousand guineas was graciously received from him
by Charles. Ten thousand more were accepted by
James, who readily consented to become a holder of
stock.... Of what the dictator expended
no account was asked by his colleagues."<note place="foot"><p>Macaulay, chap, xviii.</p></note> His
policy was so far successful as to obtain a decision
in favour of the company's privileges from Jeffreys
and a renewal of its charter from James. Just at
a time when the prospects of the company looked
brightest a sudden change of fortune was occasioned
by the Revolution and the subsequent accession of the
Whigs to power. The outcry raised by the general
merchants of the city against the company became
louder than ever, not so much on account of the company
being in possession of a monopoly as because it
was ruled by a single individual, and his rule, while
benefiting himself and his creatures, was prejudicial to
the public welfare. To this outcry Papillon, who had
now returned from exile, added his voice and thereby
subjected himself to a charge of inconsistency.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>A New Company formed, 1689.</p></note>

<p>There was but one remedy for the existing evil
in the opinion of the majority, and that was to form
a new company from which Child should be excluded.<pb n="577" /><anchor id="Pg577" />
Without waiting for an Act of Parliament many traders
in the city formed themselves into an association
which, although unrecognised by law, acquired the
designation of the New Company, and commenced to
carry on its business at the hall of the Skinners' Company
in Dowgate. For years the city was kept in a
ferment by the rivalry existing between the Old and
the New Company, between Leadenhall Street and
Skinners' Hall, the former being supported by the
Tories, the latter by the Whigs.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Rivalry between the Old and the New Company.</p></note>

<p>The sanction and assistance of parliament was
sought for by both companies. The majority of the
Commons were in favour of a compromise. They
would have retained the Old Company, but wished to
remodel it and to incorporate with it the members of
the New Company. Such a proceeding, however, Child
would not listen to, and his obstinacy so provoked
the House that in February, 1692, it presented an
address to the king praying him to dissolve the Old
Company and to grant a charter to a New Company on
such terms as to his majesty's wisdom might seem fit.
The king replied that it was a matter of very great
importance to the trade of the kingdom; that he

Spanish port, but suspicion pointed to her being
intended for a voyage to the East Indies in contravention

little excitement if carried out on the high seas and
at a distance from home, but in the port of London
they were not to be tolerated. The owners of the
"Redbridge" laid their grievance before the Commons
(30 Dec.).<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 43.</p></note> They pointed out that the conduct of

prayed, therefore, that the like inconveniences might be
prevented for the future. Their petition was referred
to a committee of the whole House, together with other
petitions against the company, as well as the company's
charters. In due course the committee, with Papillon

was "a grievance, a discouragement to trade

<p>Between March, 1689, and February, 1691, little

difficulty of the claims of the City orphans. Another
committee was appointed at the expiration of that
time to consider the matter, and in November, 1691,
the committee reported to the Common Council.
They recommended that certain rents of the value
of £8,000 per annum should be set aside towards
the payment of four per cent. per annum for the
immediate relief of the orphans, and that parliament
should be asked to authorise the raising of a sum of
£24,000 to be vested in the Corporation for the
satisfaction of debts to existing orphans, and for
security of the money of orphans that should be paid
into the Chamber in future. The recommendation of
the committee was accepted by the court (20 Nov.),
and three days later a draft petition to parliament
was read and approved.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 142-144; Luttrell, ii, 307.</p></note> The petition set forth that
in the troublous times during and after the reign of

and their losses consequent on the illegal judgment
on the <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Quo Warranto</foreign>, their debts to the orphans had
amounted to a sum far larger than the City was able
to pay without the assistance of parliament. It
proceeded to lay before the House the scheme proposed
by the committee, and prayed the House to
assist the petitioners to raise a sufficient sum for an
annual payment to be made in lieu of the said debts, or
such other provision for the same as the House might
think fit. On the 27th November leave was granted

read the second time on the 22nd and committed.

<p>On the 6th March (1694) the lord keeper came
to the Guildhall, accompanied by the lords of the
treasury, to ask the Common Council for a loan of
£200,000, upon security of the land tax, for naval and
military purposes. The court at once assented, and
before the end of the month the whole amount had
been paid into the exchequer.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fos. 295b, 297; Luttrell, iii, 279, 288.</p></note> The money was raised
in the usual way from the inhabitants of each ward

itself was by no means well off, and encouragement
was given to anyone who could suggest a means
whereby the City's revenues could be increased.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 51, fo. 305.</p></note>
Recourse was had, among other things, to nominating
for sheriff the least suitable men for the office, and
such as would prefer paying the fine to serving. In
no other way can one reasonably account for the fact
that the fines for refusing to undertake the office of
sheriff amounted for this year (1694) to over £5,000.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 52, fo. 51.</p></note></p>

<p>This loan was but as a drop in the ocean compared
with the necessities of the times. The estimates for
the year 1694 were enormous. The army, which was
already the largest standing force that England had
ever seen, was to receive a large increase, whilst
considerable sums of money were required for payment
of arrears, no less than for the future expenses,
of the navy. Notwithstanding the renewal of the land
tax, the imposition of a poll-tax, the revival of stamp
duties, and the raising of a million of money by a lottery
loan, there yet remained a large deficit before the estimated
revenue of the year balanced the estimated
expenditure. At this juncture Charles Montague, poet,
politician and <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">savant</foreign>, took up a scheme propounded
to government three years before by William Paterson,
an enterprising if not always successful Scotsman,
but allowed to drop. This scheme was none other
than the formation of a national bank. The idea was
not altogether a new one. Before the close of the
reign of Charles II several plans of the kind had been
suggested, some being in favour of establishing such a
bank under the immediate direction of the Crown,
whilst others were of opinion that its management
should be entrusted to the Corporation of the city.
It was now proposed to raise the sum of £1,200,000
for the use of the government by way of loan at
eight per cent. interest, the subscribers being incorporated
by the name of the Governor and Company
of the Bank of England. The matter was introduced
into parliament for the first time on the 28th March,
in the shape of a Bill for granting their majesties
certain tonnage duties on wine, ale and other liquors.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 143, 144.</p></note><pb n="585" /><anchor id="Pg585" />
Although it was not easy to recognise in the terms of
the Bill the germ of "the greatest commercial institution
that the world had ever seen,"<note place="foot"><p>Macaulay, chap. xx.</p></note> it met with
considerable opposition in the House, and still more
outside. With their recent experience of the evils
arising from a rich and powerful body like the East
India Company, men were cautious in allowing a
Corporation to be erected in their midst which, as
many feared, would absorb the wealth of the nation,<note place="foot"><p>Burnet, iv, 223.</p></note>
and might render the Crown independent of parliament
and people. This last consideration was not unimportant,
and, in order to avert the possibility of such
a danger, a clause was inserted in the Bill forbidding
under the severest penalties the new Corporation
advancing money to the Crown without the authority
of parliament.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 162.</p></note> Subject to this and other conditions
the Bill passed the Commons, and on the 24th April
was agreed to by the Lords.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 165, 170; Journal House of
Lords, xv, 424.</p></note></p>

<p>At the head of the Commission, issued under the
Great Seal for the establishment of the new bank, stood
the name of the lord mayor, Sir William Ashurst; and
out of the twenty-four original directors at least four
rose to be chief magistrate of the city, whilst others
are known to have taken an active part in the affairs
of the municipality.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, iii, 329, 342; <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Cf.</foreign> List of directors printed in Appendix

with a success beyond all expectation. The very first
day (21 June) that the subscription lists were opened
at Mercers' Hall nearly £300,000 was received, and<pb n="586" /><anchor id="Pg586" />
within a week that amount was doubled. Sir John
Houblon, who succeeded to the mayoralty the following
year, and became the first Governor of the Bank,
subscribed £10,000, the largest amount any one
individual was allowed by the terms of the charter to
subscribe before the first day of July. The same
amount was subscribed by the lords of the treasury on
behalf of the queen. By mid-day of the 2nd July the
whole of the money (£1,200,000) had been subscribed
and the books closed.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, iii, 331-2, 333-4, 336, 338.</p></note> The Great Seal was put to the
bank charter, and business was commenced in the hall
of the Grocers' Company.</p>

<p>Hitherto, as we have seen, the city of London
had always acted (as indeed it claimed to be) as the
king's Chamber, and the occupier of the throne of
England for the time being had never hesitated to
draw upon this Chamber whenever he was in need of
money. The mode of procedure was nearly always
the same. The lords of the treasury would appear
some morning before the Common Council, and after
a few words of explanation as to the necessities of the
time, would ask for a loan, offering in most cases (we
are bound to confess) undeniable security. Supposing
that the Council agreed to raise the required loan,
which it nearly always did, the mayor for the time
being was usually instructed to issue his precept to the
aldermen to collect subscriptions within their several
wards, whilst other precepts were (in later times at
least) sent to the master or wardens of the livery
companies to do the same among the members of
their companies. There were times, also, when the<pb n="587" /><anchor id="Pg587" />
companies were called upon to subscribe in proportion
to their assessment for supplying the city with corn in
times of distress.<note place="foot"><p>The picture drawn by Macaulay ("History of England," chap. xx)
of the chancellor of the exchequer going, hat in hand, up and down
Cheapside and Cornhill, attended by the lord mayor and aldermen, and
borrowing £100 from this hosier and £200 from that ironmonger, is
altogether too fanciful.</p></note> Times were now changed. Instead
of applying to the City for an advance in case of need,
the king thenceforth drew what he required from the
Bank of England. During the remainder of his reign
William only applied twice to the City for a loan:
once, towards the close of 1696, when he required
money for the army and navy, and again in 1697,
when it was necessary to pay off his continental allies
and lay up the navy after the peace of Ryswick
(10 Sept.).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 52, fos. 91, 113b, 142, 142b.</p></note> The City, in its corporate capacity, was

<p>In December of this year (1694)—soon after his

suffered an irreparable loss by the death of the
queen. The old adage touching an ill wind received a
curious exemplification at Queen Mary's death, for
although that event sent down the stock of the Bank
of England three per cent., it benefited the East
India Company by causing a rapid rise in the price of

company happened to possess a large quantity.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, iii, 419.</p></note> The

<p>The funeral did not take place until the 6th
March (1695). In anticipation of that event the
Court of Aldermen had some time since (18 Jan.)
appointed a committee to consider of the right and
title of the lord mayor, aldermen and sheriffs of the
city to their mourning and their places in the funeral
procession, as also of the mourning due to the several
officers of the city. Four days later (22 Jan.) the
committee reported<note place="foot"><p> Repertory 99, fos. 245, 262.</p></note> to the effect that they had
found from the records of the city that it had been
the custom for the lord mayor, aldermen, recorder,
sheriffs and the principal and other officers of the
city to have mourning allowed them by the Crown at
the public interments of kings and queens, but as to
the places and precedency of the lord mayor and
aldermen on those occasions the committee had only
found one instance of a funeral procession, and that
was at the funeral of Henry VII, when it appeared
that the aldermen walked "next after the knights
and before the great chaplains of dignitys and the
knights of the garter being noe lords." The lord
mayor (the report went on to say) was not named in
the procession, but at the mass and offering at the
interment it appeared that the lord mayor, with his<pb n="589" /><anchor id="Pg589" />
mace in hand, offered next after the lord chamberlain,
and the aldermen who had been mayors offered next
to the knights of the garter and before the knights of

not been lord mayor.<note place="foot"><p>See above, chap. xii.</p></note> The committee concluded
their report by recommending that a deputation
should wait upon the Privy Council and assert the

and the usual mourning was allowed by warrant
(29 Jan.).<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 99, fo. 320.</p></note> The citizens marked their respect for the

<p>The session of 1695 of William's first parliament

corruption. That every man had his price was
scarcely less true in William's day than it was in the
later age of Sir Robert Walpole. The discovery of
one delinquent guilty of receiving money for services,
real or supposed, quickly led to another, until suspicion
turned upon the City of London itself. A rumour
rapidly gained ground to the effect that the funds of

had been largely employed in winning the favour of

accompanied Sir Robert Clayton, at the latter's
request, professedly for the purpose of thanking the
Speaker for his pains about the Orphans' Bill; that
this being done, the Chamberlain, who had gone with
them, pulled out a note or bill which he handed to
the Speaker, but as to the nature of the note or bill
Houblon declared himself to have been ignorant until
subsequently informed by the Chamberlain. Other<pb n="591" /><anchor id="Pg591" />
members of the Corporation Committee also gave
evidence as to the warrant for payment of the money
having been originally made out with a blank space
left for the name of the payee. The report further
declared that sums of money had been paid to Paul
Godrell, clerk of the House of Commons, to the city
solicitor, the solicitor-general and the chairman of
the Corporation Committee in respect of the Orphans'
Bill, whilst the orphans themselves had been prevailed
upon to give security for the payment of five per cent.

professed to be able to render valuable services in

<p>By the time that the reading of the committee's

moved and put to the house by Trevor himself, that
the Speaker, by receiving a gratuity of 1,000 guineas
from the city of London after passing of the Orphans'

<note place="margin"><p>Transactions between the City and the Marquis of Normanby.</p></note>

<p>A month later (18 April) the House of Lords were
busy investigating the conduct of the Marquis of
Normanby in accepting, and of the Corporation of the
City in granting, a lease of a certain plot of land lying
behind Clarendon House, part of the City's estate
known as Conduit Mead. It was shown by oral and
documentary evidence that a longer lease than usual
had recently been granted (Jan., 1695) to the marquis
as "a gratification," he being a person of distinction<pb n="592" /><anchor id="Pg592" />
who had shown himself very friendly to the interests
of the City and likely to continue so.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 52, fo. 37b.</p></note> Negotiations
for a lease had been commenced so far back as
January, 1694, "before the Orphans' Bill was on the
anvill in the House of Commons."<note place="foot"><p>Evidence of Sir Robert Clayton.—Journal House of Lords, xv, 551.</p></note> It was not denied
that the City entertained the hope that the marquis
would use his interest in expediting the passage of
the Bill, and that this hope had been realised. On
the other hand it was shown that when the marquis
learnt that one of the conditions of the lease was
that he should "covenant" to procure an Act of
Parliament for settling some doubts of title to the
land conveyed, he at once declared that such a thing
was not in his power, but lay with the king, the lords
and the commons; nevertheless, he consented to use
his best endeavours in that direction. The marquis,
it was said, had also been indiscreet enough to divulge
certain proceedings of the House of Lords in the
matter of the Convex Lights, and this formed the
subject of an investigation by the House at the same
time as the granting of this lease. After careful
consideration the House entirely acquitted his lordship
of blame in both cases.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, xv, 546-558.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Corrupt practices of East India Company in connection with its charter.</p></note>

<p>In considering the City's action in respect of the
Orphans' Bill we must not forget to take into account
the condition of the age. It was one in which
peculation and venality were predominant. Nearly
every official who was worth the buying could be
bought, and the world thought none the worse of
him provided that these pecuniary transactions were<pb n="593" /><anchor id="Pg593" />
kept decently veiled. The "gifts and rewards"
bestowed by the City with the object of expediting
the passage of the Orphans' Bill were as nothing
compared with the vast sums which the East India
Company was reported to have disbursed in order
to obtain the confirmation of its charter. It was the
practice when Sir Thomas Cook was in power
for the directors of the company to sign warrants
for any sum that he might require without demanding
particulars from him. In seven years (1688-1694)
more than £100,000 had been disposed of for
the company's "special service," nearly £90,000 of
which had been disbursed whilst Cook was governor
(1692-1693).<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 268.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="Proceedings against Cook and Firebrace." /><note place="margin"><p>Sir Thomas Cook and Sir Basil Firebrace.</p></note>

<p>A parliamentary committee endeavoured to obtain
some account as to how this large sum of money had
been expended, but could learn nothing more than that
it had been spent on the "special service" of the company
and that a great part of it had been entrusted to
Sir Basil Firebrace.<note place="foot"><p>He had been appointed alderman of the Ward of Billingsgate by
commission of James II in 1687, in which year he also served as sheriff.—Repertory
92, fo. 363.</p></note> Firebrace denied this, but confessed
to having received upwards of £16,000 for which
he had accounted to the company. The committee's
report proceeded to inform the House that the company
had spent considerable sums of money, under the guise
of contracts, in buying up the interests of "interlopers"
and getting them to join the company. They had
found Sir Samuel Dashwood, Sir John Fleet, Sir
Thomas Cook (all aldermen of the city), Sir Joseph
Herne and John Perry to have been cognisant of<pb n="594" /><anchor id="Pg594" />
these proceedings, but they being members of parliament
the committee did not think fit to send for or
examine them.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 267-269.</p></note> Acting upon the committee's report,
the House called upon Sir Thomas Cook (26 March)
to give an account of the sum of £87,000 which he
had received of the company's money, and upon his
refusing committed him to the Tower.<note place="foot"><p>Id., xi, 283.</p></note> A Bill was
within a few days introduced into the House for
compelling Cook to make disclosure and rapidly passed
(6 April).<note place="foot"><p>Id., xi, 285, 291, 293, 294, 295.</p></note> In the Upper House the Bill met with the
strongest denunciation by the Duke of Leeds (who
saw in it considerable danger to himself), as also
by Cook himself, who was brought from the Tower
for the purpose of allowing him to plead against
the passing of such a Bill. At the Bar of the
House the latter earnestly implored the Peers not
to pass the Bill in its present form. Let them
pass a Bill of Indemnity and he would tell them
all. The Lords considered his request reasonable,
and after a conference with the Lower House it was
agreed that the Bill should take the form of an
Indemnity Bill, and so it was passed (19 April), a
joint committee of both Houses being appointed to
examine Cook and others.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 307, 308; Journal House of
Lords, xv, 543, 544, 559; Luttrell, iii, 462. Macaulay (chap. xxi)

imploring the Peers, "with tears and lamentations," not to subject him
to "a species of torture unknown to the mild laws of England."</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Examination of Cook, 23 April, 1695.</p></note>

<p>His examination, which took place in the Exchequer
Chamber on the 23rd April, confirmed the
committee's previous suspicions.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 317.</p></note> The sum of £10,000<pb n="595" /><anchor id="Pg595" />
had been paid (he said) to Sir Basil Firebrace about
November, 1693, when the charter of the East India
Company had been confirmed, and he had always
been under the apprehension that Firebrace had
pocketed the money "to recompense his losses in the
interloping trade." A further sum of £30,000 had
been paid to Firebrace on various contracts. There
had been a contract involving the payment of £60,000
on account of procuring a new charter, and another
of the value of £40,000 on account of getting the
charter sanctioned by an Act of Parliament, but as
no Act was passed this latter contract fell through.
There was a further sum of £30,000 which had been
lost to the company on account of certain stock it
had agreed to purchase from Firebrace at the price of
£150 per cent. at a time when the company's stock
was standing at par. Firebrace had always refused
to give him any account as to how this money was
disposed of, and had declared that "if he were
further pressed he would have no more to do in it."
Such was the sum and substance of Cook's confession
so far as it affected Firebrace.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Examination of Firebrace, 24-26 April, 1695.</p></note>

<p>The next day (24 April) Firebrace appeared
before the committee. As to the £10,000 he had
received from Cook, that was (he said) a gratuity
which had been given to him before the granting of
the charter. The other sum of £30,000 was due on
a contract "for favours and services done." He was
positive that both sums were intended "directly for
himself and for the use of no other person whatsoever";
that he paid nothing thereout towards
procuring either charter or Act, nor had promised to
do so. He acknowledged himself to have been very<pb n="596" /><anchor id="Pg596" />
active in his endeavours to gain over interlopers, and
to improve the stock of the company, but when
pressed by the committee for particulars he asked to
be excused giving an immediate answer on the score
of ill-health; he had not slept for two nights and was
much indisposed.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 320, 321.</p></note> On the 25th and following day
he was well enough to volunteer further evidence
incriminating the Duke of Leeds. He told the
committee of an interview he (Firebrace) had had
with Sir Thomas Cook, when the latter expressed
his apprehension lest the passing the East India
Company's charter should be opposed by the lord
president. They had then agreed to endeavour to
win his lordship's favour by an offer of 5,000 guineas.
That sum had been actually left at the duke's house,
and it was only returned on the morning the enquiry
opened. After the payment of the money both
Cook and himself had enjoyed free access to the
duke and found him willing to give them his
assistance.<note place="foot"><p>Id., xi, 322, 323.</p></note></p>

<p>On Sunday the 12th May, 1695, William again
set out for the continent, and did not return until the
10th October. The great feature of the campaign
was the brilliant siege and recovery of the town of
Namur, which had been lost to the allied forces three
years before. Baulked in a proposed design against
the king's person by his unexpected departure, the
Jacobites had to content themselves with other
measures. On the 10th June, the birthday of the
unfortunate Prince of Wales, a number of them met
at a tavern in Drury Lane. Excited by wine they
sallied forth, with drums beating and colours flying,
and insisted on passers by drinking the prince's health.<pb n="598" /><anchor id="Pg598" />
This roused the indignation of the neighbours, who
sacked the tavern and put the revellers to flight, one of

to Newgate.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, iii, 483-484.</p></note> When, in the following August, the whole

news of the fall of Namur, the citizens were suddenly
amazed at the sight of a horseman in military uniform
riding through the main streets and announcing that
William had been killed. That the wish was father
to the thought became sufficiently clear to the
by-standers when they heard the man declare with
pistol in hand and sword drawn that he would kill
anyone who denied the truth of his statement. A
serious disturbance was avoided by his being incontinently
dragged from his horse and carried before
the lord mayor, who committed him to prison.<note place="foot"><p>Id., iii, 512.</p></note></p>

being demanded by three other candidates, viz., Sir<pb n="599" /><anchor id="Pg599" />

<p>The king's return was a signal for fresh action
on the part of the Jacobites. It was resolved to
assassinate William on his return from hunting in
Richmond Park. The management of the conspiracy
was entrusted to Sir George Barclay, a Scotch
refugee, who succeeded in getting together a small
band of men willing to take part in the desperate
enterprise. The plot was, however, discovered, and
some of the leading conspirators arrested. On the
evening of Sunday the 23rd February (1696) the lord
mayor (Sir John Houblon) was summoned to the
Privy Council and informed of the narrow escape of
the king. He was charged to look well to the safety

<p>The discovery of the assassination plot had the
result of rendering William's seat on the throne more
secure than ever, and won for him the unqualified
support of parliament. Early in February (1696) a
Bill had been brought in to exclude from the House
every person who did not possess a certain estate in
land. The Bill met with much opposition in commercial
circles, and more especially in the city of
London,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 52, fos. 80, 90.</p></note> and the king being unwilling to estrange
those merchants and traders who had so often assisted
him, exercised his prerogative and declined to give his
assent to the Bill. Thereupon some violent Tories
moved that whoever advised the king to take this
course was an enemy to him and the nation; but the
House displayed its loyalty by rejecting the motion
by an overwhelming majority and ordering the division
list to be published.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xi, 427, 556.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Resolution of the Common Hall, 29 Sept., 1696.</p></note>

<p>The City was not behindhand in renewing its

stand by the king with their lives and fortunes, and
desired the city members of parliament to see that a

<p>At the time when this resolution was passed the
king was expected home from the continent, whither
he had gone in May last. During his absence there
had occurred a monetary crisis—the first since the
establishment of the Bank of England—which, after
causing for several months a great amount of distress,
was destined to be succeeded by a long period of
unbroken prosperity. An Act had recently been
passed for calling in all clipt money and substituting
milled money in its stead,<note place="foot"><p>Stat. 7 and 8 Will. III, c. 1. By a subsequent Act (Stat. 7 and 8
Will. III, c. 19) encouragement was given for bringing plate into the
Mint to be coined. The exportation of all silver except foreign silver
was prohibited, and certificates to the effect that silver about to be
exported was foreign silver and not plate or clipt money had to be
obtained in the city from the aldermen before exportation was allowed.
Three volumes of these "bullion certificates" are preserved in the Town
Clerk's office.</p></note> and the crisis was brought
about by the old money being called in before the new
money was ready for issue. Saturday, the 2nd May,
was practically the last day clipt money was received
by the exchequer. Three days later the stock of
milled money in the coffers of the Bank of England
at Grocers' Hall had run out, and the governor of the
Bank, Sir John Houblon, who happened at the time
to be also lord mayor, had to propitiate the numerous
claimants for the new money by offering them part
payment in the old coin and the rest in the new as
soon as it was minted.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, iv, 55. It is said that the goldsmiths of the city had
collected all the available paper of the Bank for the express purpose of
presenting it for cash at a time when they knew full well that the Bank
was short of milled money, hoping thereby to injure the credit of the
institution which was ruining their business.</p></note></p>

<p>Towards the end of July matters became worse.
In spite of the extraordinary activity displayed by the
Mint authorities, at the Tower and in divers parts of
the country, the supply had not equalled the demand,
yet a large sum of money was now imperatively
demanded for payment of the army on the continent.
The king himself had written to say that unless the
money was forthcoming his troops were ready to
mutiny or desert. Nothing less than a million would
satisfy the requirements of the army in Flanders, a
like sum was wanted for the navy, whilst half that
amount was necessary for the army in England.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, iv, 90.</p></note>
How was this enormous sum to be raised? It was
thought that the City might vote something towards
it, but the Chamberlain declared that any proposal
for a loan at that time would with difficulty be
carried into execution owing to the scarcity of money.<note place="foot"><p>Id., iv, 91.</p></note>
Some private individuals, however, managed to raise
£200,000 for the king, whilst others, like Sir Josiah
Child, Charles Duncombe and Sir Joseph Herne, were
prepared to stand security for £300,000 more, which
the Dutch were ready to advance. After long deliberation
the Bank of England agreed (15 Aug.) to advance
another £200,000.<note place="foot"><p>Id., iv, 97.</p></note> These sums sufficed for the more
immediate wants of the king, and allowed time for

<note place="margin"><p>The City's address of loyalty to William.</p></note>

<p>After the death of James II at St. Germains
(5 Sept., 1701) Louis broke his vow (made at
Ryswick) not to do anything to disturb or subvert
the government of England, and forthwith proclaimed
the late king's son to be heir to his father's throne.
The whole English nation was stirred against the
French king for having dared to acknowledge as
their sovereign the boy who had been held to be
supposititious and whose title to the crown had been
rejected by parliament. The citizens of London were
among the first to express their loyalty to William
and their readiness to do their utmost to preserve his
person and government against all invasion. The
king was on the continent at the time, but an address
to this effect, unanimously agreed to by the Common
Council (26 Sept.), was forwarded to him by the
lords justices, who held the reins of government during
his absence, and who in due course were instructed to
inform the City of the great satisfaction its address
had afforded his majesty. The example thus set was
quickly followed by others, and similar addresses
began to flow in from all parts of the kingdom,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 53, fos. 123, 149; Luttrell, v, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99. The
address is printed in Noorthouck, "Hist. of London" (p. 287, note).</p></note><pb n="608" /><anchor id="Pg608" />

<p>A few hours before the City's address reached the
hands of the lords justices the citizens had assembled
(29 Sept.) in Common Hall to choose a mayor for
the ensuing year. Sir Charles Duncombe, who had
amassed a large fortune as a goldsmith and banker,
and who, although returned by the livery at the head
of the poll the previous year, had been set aside
by the Court of Aldermen in his contest for the
mayoralty probably on account of his Tory principles,<note place="foot"><p>Evelyn (Diary, 11 June, 1696) writes of him as having been
formerly a "mean goldsmith" and become rich by extortion. He had
purchased an estate at Helmsley, co. York, once the property of the
Duke of Buckingham, a transaction which drew forth the following
lines from Pope (Imitation of Bk. ii, Satire ii, of Horace <emph>sub fine</emph>):—</p>

<lg>
<l>"And Helmsley, once proud Buckingham's delight,</l>
<l>Slides to a Scrivener or City Knight."</l>
</lg>

<p>He had received a commission as alderman from James II in 1685, was
discharged the following year, and in 1700, when he was sheriff, got
himself elected alderman of Bridge Ward (Repertory 90, fo. 71;
<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign> 91, fo. 83b; <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Id.</foreign> 104, fo. 345). The city Journals of the period
are very imperfect, and there are no Common Hall books of the day,
but Luttrell gives us the result of the mayoralty election of 1700, when
Duncombe promised to lay out £40,000 for the good of the city, or
build a Mansion House for future mayors, and set up a brass statue of
King William upon the Conduit in Cheapside, if only he were elected
(Diary, iv, 660, 692).</p></note>
was again put up as a candidate, although in point of
seniority he was one of the youngest aldermen. This
time he failed to get a majority of votes at the
Common Hall, but his popularity was still sufficiently
strong to return him second on the poll, and his name
was submitted in conjunction with that of William
Gore to the Court of Aldermen for them to select
one. It was quite within their province to select if
they chose the second name submitted to them—they<pb n="609" /><anchor id="Pg609" />
had frequently done so before—but in the face of
Louis's recent act of insolence they preferred to call
to the mayoralty chair a man whose Tory principles
were not too pronounced rather than one who had
accepted an alderman's commission from James II, and
Sir William Gore was accordingly declared elected.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, v, 95.</p></note></p>

December.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 50, fo. 359; Luttrell, v, 108.</p></note> Great excitement prevailed in the city
over this election. The Whigs met at the Crown
Tavern behind the Exchange and agreed to put up
three of the old members, viz., Clayton, Ashurst and
Heathcote, and to run a fresh candidate in the person
of Sir Thomas Abney. The Tory or "Church party"
opposed these candidates with four others, viz., Sir
William Gore, the lord mayor, Sir John Fleet, Sir
Richard Levett and Sir Charles Duncombe, the recently
defeated candidate for the mayoralty. When it came

majority.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, v, 110-111, 112-113, 114.</p></note> This was the last parliament of

<p>On the day that William died the Lords Spiritual

of the Privy Council, a number of other "principall
gentlemen of quality" and the lord mayor, aldermen
and citizens of London, proceeded to draw up a document
proclaiming the Princess Anne successor to the

on that same afternoon public proclamation of

accession.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 53, fo. 281b. The address is printed in Maitland's History

themselves into "close" mourning, each alderman providing
himself with a mourning gown at his own

provide similar gowns for the chief officers of the

been done on the demise of Charles II.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 106, fo. 215.</p></note> They further<pb n="611" /><anchor id="Pg611" />
resolved, with her majesty's permission, to cause her

and a statue of her to be set up at the Royal Exchange.
It was found on enquiry that the statues of kings and
queens already in the Royal Exchange had been set
up at the expense of the companies, except those of
William and Mary, which (as we have seen) were
erected by order of the Common Council. On the
other hand, the pictures of Charles II, James II and
of William and Mary had all been paid for by the
Chamber. Artists were invited to send in sketches or
designs for her majesty's picture; and this having
been done, the work was entrusted to Closterman.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 106, fos. 226, 235, 243, 321; Journal 53, fo. 382. The

<note place="margin"><p>Parliament contunues notwithstanding demise of the crown, Stat. 7 &amp; 8 Will. III, c. 15.</p></note>

<p>Before the Revolution it had been the custom for
parliament to cease to exist immediately on the demise
of the crown. It was held that inasmuch as the king<pb n="612" /><anchor id="Pg612" />
was the head of the parliament, and as the members
of a living body could not continue to exist without a
head, so a parliament could not continue without a
king, but must with the death of the king, <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">ipso facto</foreign>,
itself expire. The inconveniences arising from this
had at length become so apparent that an Act had
recently been passed permitting a parliament in existence
at the demise of the crown to be continued for
a period of six months after such demise.<note place="foot"><p>Stat. 7 &amp; 8 Will. III, c. 15.</p></note> By virtue
of this Act the parliament, which had met for the first

<p>The "good" Queen Anne, warmly attached as
she was to the Church of England, was naturally
inclined towards the Tories in preference to the Whigs,
and lost no time in dismissing Somers, Halifax and
other Whig ministers of the late king and filling their
places with Tories. Her action in this respect
influenced the coming elections more especially in the
city of London, where a new commission of lieutenancy
appointed by the queen had already turned out six
colonels of Whiggish proclivities and had put in their
place others of a different political character.<note place="foot"><p>"A new commission for the lieutenancy of London," writes
Luttrell (11 July, 1702) "is come from her majestie, since which they
have mett and turned out the six old collonells, viz., Sir Robert Clayton,
Sir William Ashurst, Sir Thomas Stamp, Sir Thomas Lane, Sir Thomas
Abney and Sir Owen Buckingham, and chose in their room Sir William
Pritchard, Sir John Fleet, Sir Francis Child, Sir Samuel Dashwood, Sir
Thomas Cook and Sir Charles Duncombe."—Diary, v, 193.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>The city members.</p></note>

<p>Only one of the old Whig members managed to
retain his seat, viz., Gilbert Heathcote, who had recently
been elected alderman of Walbrook ward in the place<pb n="613" /><anchor id="Pg613" />
of Sir John Moore, deceased, and who may have
inherited some of the Tory principles of his predecessor
together with the aldermanic gown. There is nothing
like office for chastening a man's political opinions.
However this may have been, his three colleagues
elected to serve with him in the coming parliament
were also aldermen of the city and staunch Tories.
These were Sir William Pritchard, Sir John Fleet and
Sir Francis Child. A scrutiny had been demanded by
Clayton, Ashurst and Abney, the defeated candidates,
but it failed to disturb the result of the poll.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, v, 198.</p></note> Clayton

countries on the 4th May,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 53, fo. 402.</p></note> and although he had

The queen, who was attired in purple, and wore her
collar and George, was met at Temple Bar by the
mayor, aldermen and sheriffs on horseback. The
city sword, having been presented to her majesty and
restored to the mayor, was carried by him next before
her majesty's coach to the cathedral. The streets
from St. James' to Temple Bar were lined by the
Westminster militia, and from Temple Bar to Ludgate
by two regiments of the city trained bands. The
balconies and windows were hung with carpets and
tapestry. On arriving at St. Paul's her majesty was
met at the door by the Peers and escorted to the
choir of the cathedral by the Duke of Somerset and
the lord chamberlain, the sword of state being borne
before her by the Duke of Ormond. The spectacle
which presented itself inside St. Paul's on this occasion
has scarcely ever been equalled. Opposite the altar,
on a throne of state, sat the queen. The Peers were
accommodated with seats in the body of the choir,
whilst the Commons sat in the stalls and upper
galleries on either side. In the two lower galleries
next the throne sat the foreign ministers and ladies
"of quality." There were two other galleries near
the altar, one on the north side and the other on the
south side of the church. The latter was occupied by
the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs, whilst the former
was occupied (as usual) by their ladies. The sermon
was preached by the Bishop of Exeter. The night

her on her judgment in selecting Marlborough for the

the tottering empire, relieved Savoy, chastised the
Elector of Bavaria, and curbed the ambition of the
French king." They prayed that her majesty
might long live a terror to her enemies, a defence to
her injured neighbours and a delight to her subjects.
The next day (31 Aug.) the mayor issued his precept
to the several livery companies to prepare their
rails, stands, banners and other usual "ornaments of

in the street as should be assigned to them.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 54, fo. 134.</p></note> Several

this occasion because, parliament not being then in
session, the members of neither House were to be in
attendance. How matters were eventually arranged
does not appear, but the Court of Aldermen up to the
last moment were emphatic in their resolution that
the lord mayor should insist on keeping his place in
the cathedral, and a week later (14 Sept.) appointed

<p>In the meantime, whilst Marlborough had been
so successfully carrying on the work which the late
king had set himself to do, the city of London had
been busy setting its house in order. The poor were
with them in greater numbers than ever. The statute
(13 and 14 Chas. II, c. 12) passed in 1662 for the
better relief of the poor of the kingdom, authorising
the erection of workhouses, necessitated the expenditure
of a great deal of money, and a sum amounting
to nearly £5,000 had to be periodically raised for the
purpose by assessment of the several parishes of the
city.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 52, fo. 228; Journal 53, fos. 382-384, 388-390; Journal
54, fos. 42-46, 485-493; Journal 55, fos. 39-41.</p></note> Besides this there was a yearly sum of £8,000
due by the City to the orphans and its other
creditors, a sum which exceeded the City's yearly
revenue. The consequence was that the City had
become greatly in debt. To remedy this state of affairs
various methods were resorted to. An attempt was<pb n="619" /><anchor id="Pg619" />
made at the commencement of the present reign to
get the queen's sanction for compelling every governor,
deputy governor, or committeeman of both the East
India companies to take up the freedom of the City.
The question was referred to the attorney-general,
whose opinion on the matter was duly reported to the
Common Council.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 53, fos. 263, 268, 285, 303.</p></note></p>

<p>On the 1st July, 1703, another committee was
appointed to examine the state of the Chamber, and
to consider of ways and means for its supply and for
the support of the government of the city. On the
18th August this committee recommended to the
Common Council that an exact survey of all the
City's estate should be made in each ward by the
alderman and his deputy, and that such surveys
should be sent to the town clerk so that they might
be entered in a book. The court approved of the
recommendation, and ordered that it should be carried
out "with all expedition imaginable."<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 545, 548-549.</p></note> The City's
markets,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 53, fos. 716-726.</p></note> the City's beams<note place="foot"><p>Journal 54, fos. 53-56.</p></note> and everything else that
could be let on lease were let at improved rentals, and
everything that could be sold was sold. On the 4th
November (1703) the lord mayor (Sir John Parsons)
informed the Common Council that towards the
payment of the City's debts his lordship and the two
sheriffs had agreed to lay before the court certain
papers showing (1) what the several places under
the Corporation would sell for, (2) what the lord
mayor himself and the sheriffs were willing to take
for their share of each place, and (3) what part of the<pb n="620" /><anchor id="Pg620" />
purchase-money might be devoted to the liquidation
of the City's debts.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 53, fos. 714-716.</p></note></p>

<p>The schedule is an interesting one as showing
the value attached to various offices under the City.
Thus a water-bailiff's place would sell for £2,200, a
sword-bearer's for £2,500, and that of a clerk of the
Chamber for as much as £2,600 (the highest of all),
whilst a City solicitor could purchase his place for
£1,500, and a City remembrancer could do the same
for £1,200. The scheme proposed by the mayor
and sheriffs on this occasion affected no less than
one hundred and sixty-three places of employment,
and was simplicity itself, being nothing more than
that they themselves and their successors should
forego one-third of the value of any place that
became vacant during their year of office, and that
this third should be devoted to payment of the City's
liabilities. The total value of these purchaseable
places amounted to £107,860, one-third of which, viz.,
£35,953 6<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> 8<abbr rend="font-style: italic">d.</abbr>, would, if this proposal were carried
out (and <emph>if every place fell vacant within the year</emph>),
be available for the discharge of the City's debts.
In a second schedule were set out certain other
places filled chiefly by artificers, who, by their
extravagant charges, had contributed (it was said) in
no small degree to the City's indebtedness. These
were to be excluded from the scheme, much to their
disappointment. When any one of them died,
surrendered his place or was dismissed from it for
just cause, his place was not to be filled up, and the
payment of 10<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr> a week, more or less, which such<pb n="621" /><anchor id="Pg621" />
artificer had been in the habit of receiving from the
City, "work or not work," was to cease.</p>

<p>The proposals thus laid before the Common
Council met with the approval of the court, and the
committee was instructed to embody them in a Bill.
A Bill was accordingly drawn up and read the first
time on the 4th February, 1704. It passed on the
24th,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 53, fos. 714, 730, 739, 744-746. The Act was entitled
"An Act to prevent the further declining state of the city of London."
(<emph>Printed</emph>.)</p></note> and the thanks of the Common Council were
returned to the mayor and sheriffs for their generous
offers.</p>

<p>In March, 1705, Marlborough sailed for Holland
to resume the campaign. By July he had succeeded
in forcing the French lines which stretched across the
country from Namur to Antwerp. For this success
another thanksgiving service was held at St. Paul's,
and attended by the queen in person (23 Aug.).<note place="foot"><p>Journal 54, fo. 521; Repertory 109, fo. 412.</p></note>
Had the general been allowed a free hand by his
Dutch allies a decisive battle might have been fought.
The Dutch officers refused, however, to co-operate in
an attack, and Marlborough had to give way with the
best grace he could.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Tories give place to Whigs." /><note place="margin"><p>Meeting of the new parliament, 25 Oct., 1705.</p></note>

<p>During Marlborough's absence the parliament of
1702, which would soon have terminated by efflux of
time under the provisions of the Triennial Act, had
been dissolved (5 April) and a new one summoned.
Once more the political pendulum swung back and a
Whig parliament was returned. The Tories rather
injured than aided their cause by raising the cry that
the Church was in danger, whilst the Whig party was<pb n="622" /><anchor id="Pg622" />
daily increasing in favour not only with the queen,
who highly resented such a cry, but also with
Marlborough and Godolphin. In the city both
parties put up four candidates, but when the poll was
declared it was found that all four Whigs had been
returned by an overwhelming majority.<note place="foot"><p>Their names were Clayton, Ashurst, Heathcote and a new candidate
in the person of Samuel Shepheard, the Tories who were put up
in opposition being Sir John Fleet, Sir John Parsons, Sir William
Withers and Sir Richard Hoare (Luttrell, v, 541-542, 543). Upon
the death of Sir Robert Clayton in 1707 his seat was won by a Tory,
viz., Sir William Withers, who was lord mayor at the time (Luttrell,
vi, 236, 237). Withers had previously sat in the short parliament of
1701 (Feb.-Nov.) in the Whig interest (Luttrell, iv, 721).</p></note> One of
the results of an understanding arrived at between
Marlborough and the Tory leaders with the Whig
Junto was a modification of an article in the Act
of Settlement, which, after the accession of the
House of Hanover, would have otherwise debarred
ministers and other placemen from the House of
Commons. A compromise was effected whereby
only those who enjoyed a pension or office created
after the 25th October, 1705, were to be disqualified
from sitting in the House, whilst all other offices
were declared compatible with a seat if the holder
presented himself to his constituents for re-election
at the time of his appointment.<note place="foot"><p>Stat. 6 Anne, c. vii, secs. 25, 26.</p></note> This arrangement

<p>After a brief stay in England, where he had

Marlborough again crossed over to Holland before the

It was not, however, until the 19th December,
when the Duke of Marlborough was sumptuously

were brought into the city in great state, there to be

<p>These successes were not achieved without great

an order under the royal sign manual requiring him
and the Court of Aldermen to forthwith impress 1,000<pb n="624" /><anchor id="Pg624" />
men—such as had no visible means of subsistence—for
service by land or sea,<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, v, 623.</p></note> whilst in the following
March (1706) it was found necessary to open a
subscription at Mercers' Chapel for furnishing Prince
Eugene with £250,000 to assist him in carrying on
the campaign in Italy. Notwithstanding the depressed
state of the Corporation finances, the city abounded
in wealth, and by the close of the first day no less
than £160,000 of the whole loan had been underwritten,
Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Sir William Scawen,
Sir James Bateman and Sir Henry Furnese making
themselves each responsible for the sum of £4,000.<note place="foot"><p>Id., vi, 24.</p></note>

<p>It was not long before the crimson velvet gown

had attended the allied armies in 1706 that the queen
ordered another day of public thanksgiving to be
kept on the last day of the year, when she paid
another solemn visit to St. Paul's, accompanied by
both Houses of Parliament. Strange to say the

<note place="margin"><p>Passage of gunpowder through the city.</p></note>

<p>The city was at this time in great danger from
the passage of large quantities of gunpowder through<pb n="625" /><anchor id="Pg625" />
the streets on its way to the Tower. One can realise
the immense risk which the merchant and trader ran
in pursuing his regular vocation when one reads that
on the 10th July (1706) a cart with iron-bound
wheels and laden with twenty-five barrels of gunpowder
had been overturned on Fish Street Hill and
the gunpowder scattered. Nor was this the only
accident that had occurred; the wonder is that the
entire city had not been blown up long since, seeing
that gunpowder was a commodity dealt in by grocers!
The Common Council took the matter up and made
a representation to the queen.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 54, fos. 499-501.</p></note> Next year a Bill was

previously been issued (29 April) constituting the
existing Houses of Lords and Commons the first

consequence of the Article of Union declaring the

no such address came from the University of Oxford.
It was otherwise with the city of London, where
Presbyterianism had always been in favour. On the
9th May the Common Council voted an address to
her majesty congratulating her upon the happy

present dearness was caused by the exportation of
large quantities of corn and grain to foreign countries.
The city authorities had, moreover, been informed
that wheat was selling in the north of England at 40<abbr rend="font-style: italic">s.</abbr>

<note place="margin"><p>The Court of Aldermen decline to print it, 8 Nov., 1709.</p></note>

<p>The bitter feeling against the Whigs engendered
by their overbearing and dictatorial conduct whenever
in power was increased by a sermon preached at
St. Paul's on the 5th November before the lord mayor<pb n="632" /><anchor id="Pg632" />
and aldermen by Dr. Sacheverell, a high church Tory.
Taking for his text the words of the Apostle, "In
perils among false brethren" (2 Cor., xi, 26), the
preacher advocated in its entirety the doctrine of non-resistance,
condemned every sort of toleration, and
attacked with much bitterness the Dissenters. Sir
Samuel Garrard, who had but recently entered on his
duties as lord mayor (having been elected in place of
Sir Jeffery Jeffreys, who had been excused from office
on the ground of ill-health),<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 113, fo. 410.</p></note> was himself also a high
Tory, and as such was greatly pleased with the sentiments
put forth by Sacheverell. He congratulated the
preacher on his sermon, and is said to have expressed a
hope that it would be printed. If so, it would appear
to betoken some doubt in his mind as to his brother
aldermen consenting to print such a polemical discourse.
As a rule all sermons preached on state
occasions before the mayor and aldermen were ordered
by the court to be printed as a matter of course, the
sum of forty shillings being voted towards the expense.
Two sermons recently preached before them, one at
St. Paul's and the other in the church of St. Lawrence
Jewry, were so ordered (8 Nov.) to be printed by the
court; but when on the same day the question was
put to them that Dr. Sacheverell should be desired to
print his sermon it was negatived.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 114, fo. 13.</p></note> Sacheverell took
no notice of this rebuff, but printed the sermon on
his own responsibility and at his own expense, with
a prefatory dedication to the mayor.<note place="foot"><p>A copy of the sermon "printed for Henry Clements at the Half
Moon in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1709," is preserved in the Guildhall
Library (Tracts 451).</p></note> The sermon
was immensely popular with the high church party,<pb n="633" /><anchor id="Pg633" />
and a large number of copies were circulated, much
to the disgust of the Whigs.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The sermon brought to the notice of parliament, 13 Dec., 1709.</p></note>

<p>At length the ministry resolved to take proceedings
against the author. On the 13th December
a complaint was made to the House of Commons of
this sermon, as well as of another sermon of similar
character which had been preached by Sacheverell
before the judges at the last summer assizes at Derby.
After some debate the House resolved that both these
sermons were "malicious, scandalous and seditious
libels highly reflecting upon her majesty and her
government, the late happy revolution, and the
Protestant succession as by law established," and
ordered that Dr. Henry Sacheverell and Henry
Clements, his publisher, should attend at the Bar of
the House the next day.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Sacheverell's impeachment ordered, 14 Dec., 1709.</p></note>

<p>Accordingly the next day (14 Dec.) the doctor
and the bookseller appeared. Sacheverell owned that
he was the author of the two discourses, and gave an
account of what had taken place between himself and
the lord mayor; but whilst expressing his regret at
having incurred the displeasure of the House, he
showed no contrition for the doctrines he had promulgated.
The lord mayor, who was present in the
House in his capacity as member for Agmondesham,
was thereupon asked if he had given any orders for
causing the sermon preached at St. Paul's to be printed,
but he denied having done so.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xvi, 241; Luttrell, vi, 523.</p></note> The doctor being
called upon to retire, the House resolved to impeach
him of high crimes and misdemeanours and in the
meantime committed him to the custody of the<pb n="634" /><anchor id="Pg634" />
sergeant-at-arms. Application was made a few days
later for bail to be allowed, but this the House refused.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xvi, 245, 246, 252-256.</p></note>
It was, however, subsequently granted by the Lords,
but at a very high amount, viz., Sacheverell himself
in £6,000 and two sureties in £3,000 respectively.
One of these sureties was no other than the Vice-Chancellor
of Oxford University, of which Sacheverell
was a member.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, xix, 37.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>His trial in Westminster Hall, 27 Feb., 1710.</p></note>

<p>It was originally intended that the trial should
take place at the Bar of the House of Lords, but as
the Commons insisted upon being present as a committee
of the whole House, the Lords appointed
Westminster Hall to be the place of trial and instructed
Sir Christopher Wren to make the necessary preparations
as speedily as possible.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xvi, 293; Journal House of Lords,
xix, 58, 60.</p></note> The trial commenced
on the 27th February and continued for three weeks.
Day after day as Sacheverell passed from his lodgings
in the Temple to Westminster Hall and home again
his coach was besieged by crowds striving to kiss
his hand and shouting "Sacheverell and the Church
for ever!" So again when the queen, impelled by
curiosity, attended the trial, as she did on more than
one occasion, shouts were raised as she passed on
her way of "God bless your majesty and the Church!
we hope your majesty is for Dr. Sacheverell!"
Had the mob confined itself to this kind of demonstration
little harm had been done. Unfortunately
it allowed itself to be carried away by excitement
and took to attacking meeting-houses and damaging<pb n="635" /><anchor id="Pg635" />
the property of Dissenters.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, vi, 551; Burnet, v, 444, 445.</p></note> The arguments on both
sides having at last been concluded, the Lords, by a
narrow majority, pronounced Sacheverell guilty. They
did not venture, however, to proceed against him
with any greater severity than to order his sermons
to be burnt at the Exchange by the common hangman,
in the presence of the lord mayor and sheriffs, and to
prohibit him from preaching for the next three years.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Lords, xix, 115, 118.</p></note>
Such a sentence was virtually a victory for the Tories
and a defeat of the Whigs. Lord mayor Garrard
contrived to escape the humiliation of presiding over
the burning of a sermon of which he in his heart
approved, and this part of the sentence was carried out
in his absence under the supervision of the sheriffs.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, vi, 562; Noorthouck, p. 297.</p></note>
The verdict was welcomed in the city with illuminations
and bonfires, accompanied with some little
tumult and disorder. The queen complained to the
Court of Aldermen by letter, and thereupon the court
appointed a committee to investigate the recent riots
(27 March, 1710). The result was that the ringleaders
were arrested and bound over to the sessions.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 114, fos. 153-155, 182.</p></note>
The streets were flooded with republican pamphlets
which the House ordered to be burnt by the
common hangman.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xvi, 385.</p></note> Addresses were sent in from
all parts of the country, some in favour of the

an address (but only by a small majority) in which<pb n="636" /><anchor id="Pg636" />
her majesty was assured of the City's hatred of all
"anti-monarchical principles," its continued loyalty
to her person and government, its zeal for the Church
of England, its tender regard for liberty of conscience
and its resolution to maintain the Protestant succession.
The address concluded by saying that in obedience
to her majesty's commands the civic authorities would
do their utmost care to prevent and suppress riotous
assemblies.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 55, fos. 169b-170b.</p></note> The address, together with one from the

<p>The queen seized the opportunity afforded her
by this outburst of Tory enthusiasm to get rid of the
Whig ministry. For some time past she had been
anxious to free herself from Marlborough and the
domineering influence of his wife. During the trial of
Sacheverell Marlborough had been on the continent.
In view of the approaching struggle between Whigs
and Tories, both parties preferred to be relieved of
his presence. To this end Sir Gilbert Heathcote,
one of the Whig members for the city, had moved
an address to her majesty (16 Feb.) praying she
would order the duke to Holland, "where his
presence will be equally necessary to assist at the
negotiations of peace and to hasten the preparations
for an early campaign."<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xvi, 316.</p></note> The address, having
received the unanimous assent of both Houses, was
graciously received by the queen, and Marlborough
had set out. In his absence the queen proceeded
cautiously to effect her object. One by one the
Whigs were removed from office and their places<pb n="637" /><anchor id="Pg637" />
filled up by Tories. Sunderland was the first to go,
the seals being transferred to Lord Dartmouth. It
was feared in commercial circles that his dismissal
betokened a general change of ministry and that a
panic would follow. The queen, however, assured
Sir Gilbert Heathcote, at that time governor of the
Bank of England, that she had no immediate
intention of making further changes, but that if any
were made she would take care that they should not
be prejudicial to the bank or to the common cause.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, vi, 594; Stanhope, <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">op. cit.</foreign>, pp. 426, 427.</p></note>
Notwithstanding the assurances thus given, less than
two months elapsed before Godolphin was made to
follow Sunderland. After this many of the Whig
ministers resigned, whilst others waited to be turned
out.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>Parliamentary elections, 1710.</p></note>

<note place="margin"><p>The city members.</p></note>

<p>A few weeks after the dismissal of Godolphin
the queen insisted on dissolving parliament, and writs
were issued (27 Sept.) for a new House to meet in
November.<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, vi, 634.</p></note> Harley, who was the queen's chief
adviser, having failed in an attempt to form a coalition
of Tories and moderate Whigs, placed all his hopes
in the result of a general election. Every effort was
made to get a Tory majority returned, and with
success. Bishop Burnet, whose Whiggish proclivities
are apparent in every page of his history, took no
pains to disguise his opinions as to the way the
elections were generally carried out, and more particularly
in the city of London. "While the poll was
taken in London," he writes,<note place="foot"><p>"Hist. of His Own Time," vi, 16.</p></note> "a new commission
for the lieutenancy of the city was sent in, by which
a great change was made; Tories were put in<pb n="638" /><anchor id="Pg638" />
and Whigs were left out; in a word, the practice
and violence now used in elections went far beyond
anything that I have ever known in England." If
freedom of election was to count for anything, the
worthy bishop entertained grave doubts as to the new
parliament being a representative parliament at all.
Only one of the old members was returned by the
city, viz., Sir William Withers. With him were
elected another alderman of the city, viz., Sir Richard
Hoare, who had been defeated in the Tory interest at
the last election, Sir George Newland and John Cass,<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, vi, 641, 654.</p></note>
who afterwards became an alderman, and who, at his
decease, left money for the foundation of a school in
the parish of St. Botoph, Aldgate.</p>

<note place="margin"><p>The Tory ministry, 1710-1711.</p></note>

<p>The new House of Commons being strongly Tory,
Harley and St. John found themselves compelled to
form a purely Tory ministry. On the 27th the queen
delivered a speech in person, reflecting, as was
supposed, the policy of the new ministry. To
carry on the war with the utmost vigour was, she
declared, the surest way of procuring a safe and
honourable peace for England and her allies, and
in February of the following year (1711) Marlborough
was despatched for the avowed purpose of
carrying this policy into execution, the Commons
being called upon to furnish supplies. Yet in the
midst of all this Harley commenced opening secret
negotiations for a peace with France, regardless of
the interests of England's allies. By September
(1711) these negotiations had so far progressed that
preliminaries for a peace were actually signed, but<pb n="639" /><anchor id="Pg639" />
for fear lest the favourable terms obtained for England
should provoke the jealousy of the Dutch a garbled
edition of the treaty was specially prepared for the
edification of our allies. Such was the political
morality of the age!</p>

<index index="toc" level1="Act for building fifty new Churches." /><note place="margin"><p>Act of Parliament for building fifty new churches in and around London, 28 May, 1711.</p></note>

<p>The High Church party being in power, the
queen took the opportunity of enlisting their support
for a project she had much at heart. For some time
past the want of new churches in the fast increasing
suburbs of London had engaged the attention of convocation,
by whom the matter had been represented to
the queen. Her majesty now commended "so good
and pious a work" to the attention of the Commons, a
commendation which received additional force from
the presentation of petitions from ministers of various
parishes in and around London for assistance in carrying
out repairs. The Commons showed considerable
zeal in the matter, declaring, in their reply to her
majesty's address, that neither the long expensive war
in which they were engaged nor the pressure of heavy
debts should hinder them from granting whatever
was necessary.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xvi, 567, 568, 569, 570, 574.</p></note> A Bill was accordingly brought in
(18 May) for the purpose of building fifty new
churches, computing 4,750 souls to each church, as
well as for providing annual sums of money to be
expended on the completion of Westminster Abbey
and Greenwich Hospital. The cost was to be defrayed
by a further duty on coal. By the 28th May the Bill
passed the Commons.<note place="foot"><p>Id., xvi, 583, 671, 681; Stat. 9 Anne, c. 22.</p></note></p>

was then effected which reflected little credit upon
either of the political parties, but secured the passing
of the Occasional Conformity Bill, a Bill on which the
queen and the high Tories had set their hearts, but
which had already been defeated twice by the Lords.
The object of the Bill was to inflict penalties upon
those Dissenters who, having qualified themselves to
sit as common councilmen or as officers in corporations
or elsewhere by receiving the Sacrament, afterwards
betook themselves to places of worship where the
Book of Common Prayer was not used, and where

<index index="toc" level1="Disputed Municipal Elections." /><note place="margin"><p>Disputed elections of aldermen, 1711-1712.</p></note>

<p>In September (1711) party spirit ran high in the
city, the occasion being the election of an alderman
for the ward of Broad Street in the place of Sir Joseph
Woolfe, deceased. No less than four candidates were
nominated by each side, two out of each four being
already aldermen. The Tory or Church party were
represented by Sir William Withers and William
Lewen, aldermen, Sir George Newland and Sir
Robert Dunkley, commoners. The Whigs or Dissenters
advocated Sir John Houblon and Sir Samuel
Stanier, aldermen, Sir John Scott and Gerrard Conyers,
commoners. The wardmote was held at Drapers'
Hall, and was presided over by Sir Gilbert Heathcote,
the mayor, a strong Whig. It appears from a
newspaper of the day<note place="foot"><p>The "Supplement," 12-14 September, 1711, extracts from which
are set out in Repertory 116, fos. 83 <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">et seq.</foreign></p></note> that although the mayor
caused the Act of Common Council, setting forth the
qualifications of persons who had a right to vote on<pb n="641" /><anchor id="Pg641" />
the occasion, to be read at the wardmote, he refused
to make proclamation that those who were not
qualified should depart from the hall. The result was
that a large number of foreigners and other unqualified
persons voted. The lord mayor having declared the
show of hands to be in favour of the four Whig
candidates, a poll was demanded, which reversed the
mayor's decision. A scrutiny was next asked for and
allowed, but the mayor steadily refused to express
any opinion as to who of the voters were qualified and
who were disqualified without first consulting counsel.
The result of the scrutiny was declared (27 Oct.) by
the mayor to be in favour of all four Whig candidates,
and on the following day he made a report to
that effect to the Court of Aldermen, who thereupon
elected Gerrard Conyers alderman of the ward. The
mayor's decision, however, was challenged, and a
motion was made in the Queen's Bench for setting it
aside as being manifestly wrong and not in accordance
with the number of lawful votes. After Heathcote's
year of office had expired the assistance of the
Common Council was invoked in support of the rights
of electors against such arbitrary proceedings as had
recently taken place. The court agreed to the
necessary legal expenses being defrayed by the
Chamber.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 55, fos. 270, 335-336b; Repertory 116, fos. 34, 88, 89,

inconvenience arising from this practice became so
manifest during this last election that the Common
Council passed an Act before the result of the election
had been declared, abolishing the custom and enacting
that henceforth only two candidates should be put in
nomination, one an alderman and the other a commoner.<note place="foot"><p>Act of Common Council, 20 Sept., 10 Anne, <abbr rend="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</abbr> 1711; Journal

<p>In July, 1712, another dispute arose over the
election of an alderman. Sir John Fleet, alderman of
the ward of Langbourn, had recently died, and it was
necessary to appoint a successor. Four candidates
were put up for the post, of whom two were to be
selected for nomination to the Court of Aldermen
according to the provisions of the recent Act. The
wardmote was opened on the 9th July at Pewterers'
Hall. Sir Robert Beachcroft, the lord mayor, was
himself one of the candidates, the other three being
Sir William Withers, alderman, Sir Samuel Clarke and
Peter Delmé, commoners. The show of hands being
declared to be in favour of Withers and Clarke, two
Tories, a poll was demanded on behalf of his lordship
and Delmé. The result, however, was the same, and
a scrutiny followed. To the great surprise of a large<pb n="643" /><anchor id="Pg643" />
body of the electors, the mayor eventually declared
(22 Aug.) the majority of votes to be in favour of
himself and Delmé, but like his predecessor he steadily
refused to give any explanation as to how he had
arrived at that conclusion. Again there appeared to
be no remedy but to apply to the Queen's Bench.
The Common Council was again appealed to (6 Sept.),
but whilst the matter was in course of debate the lord
mayor was suddenly taken ill, and the court had to
break up before coming to any resolution on the
matter. On the 12th November, however, the council
agreed to assist the petitioners as before, but refused
any assistance to Delmé, who had already been
admitted alderman, and was about to be put on his
defence.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 55, fos. 338b-341, 346, 346b; Repertory 116, fo. 318.</p></note></p>

<p>In 1713 the relations between the Courts of
Aldermen and Common Council became still more
strained. The latter complained of the city's business
being hindered from insufficient Courts of Aldermen,
and of a newly elected alderman not having been
sworn in on a certain day by reason of there not being
a <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">quorum</foreign> of aldermen present. On the 15th May a
joint committee of aldermen and commoners was
appointed to enquire into the matter. Six weeks
elapsed before the committee was ready with its
report. At length, on the 30th June, the committee
certified<note place="foot"><p>Journal 56, fos. 44b, 51b-52.</p></note> that having examined the minute books of
the Court of Aldermen it had found that between
the 24th March and the 15th May last six courts had
been summoned to meet, but for want of a <foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">quorum</foreign><pb n="644" /><anchor id="Pg644" />
only one full court had been held. On the other
occasions only seven, eight, nine, ten or twelve
aldermen appeared, inclusive of the mayor. The committee
also found that the courts were in the habit of
meeting between twelve and one o'clock, and reported
its opinion that such a late hour for meeting was prejudicial
to the citizens and others who had business there.</p>

<p>Touching the other matter which had been
referred to them, the committee found that on the
7th May the lord mayor had reported to the Court of
Aldermen the nomination and election of Sir William
Withers, alderman, and Joseph Lawrence to succeed
Sir Owen Buckingham in the aldermanry of the ward
of Bishopsgate; that Withers declining to remove, had
moved that Lawrence should be called in and sworn,
according to the provisions of the Act of 1711 for
regulating the elections of aldermen; that thereupon a
petition was offered and part of the Act was read;
that after some debate Lawrence was sent for and
came into court; that upon the Common Sergeant
being called in to give his opinion seven of the
aldermen withdrew from the court, but one of them
presently returned, and after hearing the Common
Sergeant deliver his opinion—viz., that notwithstanding
any petition the court was bound by the Act to admit
and swear in Lawrence—again withdrew, notwithstanding
the lord mayor's expressed desire that he
should remain; that by this means a full court was
not kept (only eleven aldermen being left with the
mayor), and so Lawrence, although present, could not
be sworn.<note place="foot"><p>Cf. Repertory 117, fo. 181.</p></note> The committee's report was ordered to<pb n="645" /><anchor id="Pg645" />

<index index="toc" level1="Proposed entertainment to Prince Eugene." /><note place="margin"><p>Visit of Prince Eugene to London, Jan., 1712.</p></note>

<p>In the meantime the queen had been persuaded
to dismiss Marlborough on his return to England
(Nov., 1711) from all his offices, and to place the
Duke of Ormond, a strong Tory, in command of the
English forces in the Netherlands. Negotiations with
France were simultaneously pushed on, in spite of a
personal visit which Eugene himself paid to London
(Jan., 1712) in the hope of obtaining a continuance of
English support for carrying on the war. The presence
of the illustrious prince was heartily welcomed by the
Whigs, by whom he was hospitably entertained.
On the 15th January a motion was made in the Court
of Aldermen and carried to the effect that the court
was prepared to join with as many leading citizens
(not exceeding sixty in number) as should be willing in
providing an entertainment by private subscription for
his highness, provided they first obtained her majesty's
permission. Two aldermen were thereupon nominated
to wait upon Lord Dartmouth, principal secretary of
state, in order to learn her majesty's pleasure. There
was nothing unusual in this proceeding. Nevertheless
the idea of the prince being publicly entertained in the
city was so distasteful to the queen and her government
that she found fault with the citizens for daring
to approach her with a mere verbal message (she was
suffering from gout at the time),<note place="foot"><p>Luttrell, vi, 714, 715.</p></note> and declined to return

by the city of London to her predecessors."<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 116, fos. 61, 68.</p></note> That
there might be no mistake about the matter the queen's
answer was sent to the City in writing by Lord Dartmouth.
The Court of Aldermen at once appointed a
committee to search the City's Records for the purpose
of ascertaining how and in what manner messages had
been delivered from the court to her majesty and her
predecessors, whether they had usually been in writing
or only verbal. On the 5th February the committee
reported that they found that such messages had been
delivered in a variety of ways: sometimes by the lord
mayor alone, sometimes by two or three aldermen,
and at other times by the recorder and sheriffs only.
One instance had been found of a message having
been sent by a single sheriff. Not once did they
find that a message had been delivered in writing.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fos. 69, 82.</p></note>
It need scarcely be said that under the circumstances
all idea of the entertainment was dropt.</p>

<p>In spite of the prince's high character the greatest
calumnies were whispered against him behind his back.
He was said to be conspiring with Marlborough and the
Whigs to raise an insurrection in the streets, fire the city
and seize the person of the queen. A general panic
prevailed. Even the roysterings of a few drunken revellers
calling themselves "Mohocks"<note place="foot"><p>For an account of this nocturnal fraternity see Addison's "Spectator,"
21 and 27 March and 8 April, 1712.</p></note>—the successors of
the "Roreres" and "Riffleres" of a past age—were
looked upon as signs and tokens of some deep laid
plot, so that more than ordinary precautions had to be
taken, both in the city and elsewhere, to prevent riot.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 55, fo. 301b; Repertory 116, fo. 132.</p></note><pb n="647" /><anchor id="Pg647" />
Finding at length that his presence in England did
not promote his object the prince, after a stay of some
weeks, returned to the Hague.</p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Treaty of Utrecht." /><note place="margin"><p>The Peace of Utrecht, 31 March, 1713.</p></note>

<p>By the 6th June negotiations with France had so
far advanced that the queen went down to the House
of Lords to fulfil, as she said, her promise of communicating
to her parliament the terms of peace before it
was absolutely concluded. What pleased the citizens
most in her elaborate speech was the announcement
of the steps taken to secure the Protestant succession
to the House of Hanover and for protecting British
commerce. For these measures they returned to her
majesty their hearty thanks, and expressed their sincere
hopes that she might speedily finish the good work
which had advanced so far notwithstanding "the artful
contrivances and envious efforts of a factious and
malicious party."<note place="foot"><p>Address to the queen voted by the Common Council, 12 June,
1712.—Journal 55, fo. 321b.</p></note> In August a proclamation was
made of a suspension of hostilities,<note place="foot"><p>Journal 55, fo. 334b.</p></note> and on the 31st
March, 1713, the Peace of Utrecht was signed.</p>

<p>A fortnight later (14 April, 1713) the Common
Council voted a congratulatory address to her majesty
on the conclusion of the peace with France, but no
copy of the address was to be shown to anyone until
it had been actually presented.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 56, fo. 6.</p></note> On the 5th May the
lord mayor and Court of Aldermen attended at Temple
Bar to assist at the proclamation, whilst Tuesday the
6th July was observed as a day of public thanksgiving
at St. Paul's. The queen did not attend the service
owing probably to indisposition, and the livery companies
were on that account excused attendance.<pb n="648" /><anchor id="Pg648" />
The mayor and aldermen displayed no little anxiety
to have their proper seats reserved for them in the
cathedral.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 117, fos. 177, 285-292.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Sacheverell presented to the living of St. Andrew's, Holborn, April, 1713.</p></note>

<p>Shortly before the conclusion of the peace the
term of Sacheverell's suspension expired. His popularity
became greater than ever. The queen presented
him with the living of St. Andrew's, Holborn, whilst
the House of Commons, which had formerly condemned
him, now invited him to preach before them.<note place="foot"><p>Journal House of Commons, xvii, p. 309.</p></note></p>

<index index="toc" level1="The Queen's illness and death." /><note place="margin"><p>The queen's indisposition, Dec., 1713, Feb., 1714.</p></note>

<p>The days of Queen Anne were now fast drawing
to a close. For some time past her health had been
failing, and at the close of the year (1713) she was
confined to her bed at Windsor. Upon notice of her
indisposition being conveyed to the Court of Aldermen
they at once instructed the sheriffs and the city
remembrancer to proceed to Windsor and enquire
after her majesty's health.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 118, fo. 60.</p></note> The fact that in the
event of the queen's death the legal heir, the
Electress Sophia, and her son, the Elector of Hanover,
were favourable to the Whig party, drove the Tories
to make overtures to the Pretender, the queen's
brother, who was still living in France, although by
the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht Louis had
promised to abandon his cause. On the 1st February
(1714) the queen wrote to the lord mayor<note place="foot"><p>The letter is not set out in the City's Records, but will be found
printed in Noorthouck (p. 305).</p></note> (Sir Samuel
Stanier) informing him that she was recovering her
health and hoped soon to return to her "usual
residence." She further informed his lordship of her<pb n="649" /><anchor id="Pg649" />
determination to open her parliament on the 16th,
according to the notice given by proclamation, and
desired him to communicate the same to the Court of
Aldermen and to her other loving subjects of the city.
Again the sheriffs and remembrancer were instructed
to go to Windsor and tender the court's acknowledgments
of her majesty's favour and to assure her that
they would discountenance to the utmost of their
power and put a stop to "those malicious rumours
which had been so industriously spread by evil
disposed persons to the prejudice of credit and the
imminent hazard of public peace and tranquility."<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 118, fo. 107.</p></note>
Saturday the 6th was the queen's birthday, and extra
precautions were taken in the city to prevent tumult
or disorder.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 56, fo. 85.</p></note> A week later her majesty had so far
recovered her health as to meditate returning to
town, and the Common Council prepared (12 Feb.)
to greet her with a congratulatory address.<note place="foot"><p>Journal 56, fo. 86.</p></note></p>

<note place="margin"><p>Proclamation for the arrest of the Pretender, 21 June, 1714.</p></note>

<p>On the 21st June (1714) a royal proclamation
was issued offering a reward of £5,000 for the
apprehension of the Pretender in case he should
effect a landing.<note place="foot"><p>Id., fo. 128.</p></note> The proclamation afforded the City
an opportunity of further testifying its loyalty to the
queen and its determination to uphold the Protestant
succession as by law established, and at the same time
to thank her majesty for passing an Act entitled "An
Act to prevent the growth of Schism"—an Act aimed
against the Whigs, and which forbade anyone keeping
a school without licence from the bishop.<note place="foot"><p>An address to this effect was agreed to by the Common Council on the

<note place="margin"><p>The death of the queen, 1 Aug., 1714.</p></note>

<p>On the morning of Friday the 30th July the
queen was seized with her last illness. Notification
was immediately despatched to the lord mayor, who
reported the news to a special Court of Aldermen
that afternoon. The Secretary of State, who had
written to the mayor, had desired his lordship to take
immediate steps to preserve quiet in the city. The
court, on being informed of the turn of affairs,
despatched the sheriffs, the common cryer and the
water bailiff to Kensington to enquire after the
queen's health and to assure her majesty that every
possible care would be taken to preserve the peace
of the city in any event.<note place="foot"><p>Repertory 118, fo. 356.</p></note> Two days later (1 Aug.)

1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.

           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™


Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.

  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.


      General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
